Community Land Surface Model (CLM) science version 5.0.0  series -- source code, tools, 
offline-build and test scripts. This gives you everything you need
to run CLM with CESM with datm8 to provide CRU NCEP or GSWP3 forcing data in 
place of a modeled atmosphere.

For lists of current bugs (issues) and current development see the CTSM GitHub page:

IMPORTANT NOTE ON CESM CHECKOUT VERSUS A CTSM CHECKOUT:

If this is the top level directory from making a clone of CTSM the 
directory structure is a little bit different than if CTSM is from 
a clone of the entire CESM. If this is part of CESM this directory
will be under components/clm alongside other CESM component models.
For a CTSM checkout this will be the top level directory.

Other documentation will refer to $CTSMROOT and it means the directory
that this file is at. CIMEROOT is the directory where "cime" is for
this checkout. For a CESM checkout $CIMEROOT will be the "cime" directory
beneath the top level directory. For a CTSM checkout $CIMEROOT will
be $CTSMROOT/cime.
