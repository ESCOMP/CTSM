Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) science version 5.3 series -- source code, tools, 
offline-build and test scripts. This gives you everything you need
to run CTSM with CESM with the CMEPS driver and CDEPS data models to provide CRUJRA or GSWP3 forcing data (some older options also available) in
place of a modeled atmosphere.

CMEPS is the Community Mediator for Earth Prediction Systems. And CDEPS is the
Community Data Models for Earth Prediction System. They are both NUOPC based models
used to drive the CESM (Community Earth System Model) of which CTSM is a component of.
NUOPC is the National Unified Operational Prediction Capability a standard way of building
coupled model systems. The NUOPC layer is based on the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).

For lists of current bugs (issues) and current development see the CTSM GitHub page:

IMPORTANT NOTE ON CESM CHECKOUT VERSUS A CTSM CHECKOUT:

If this is the top level directory from making a clone of CTSM the 
directory structure is a little bit different than if CTSM is from 
a clone of the entire CESM. If this is part of CESM this directory
will be under components/clm alongside other CESM component models.
For a CTSM checkout this will be the top level directory.

Other documentation will refer to $CTSMROOT and it means the directory
that this file is at. CIMEROOT is the directory where "cime" is for
this checkout. For a CESM checkout $CIMEROOT will be the "cime" directory
beneath the top level directory. For a CTSM checkout $CIMEROOT will
be $CTSMROOT/cime.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT (deprecated)

Anything marked with (deprecated) is something is going to be removed in a future update.
Often this means it will be replaced with something else.
