Community Land Surface Model (CLM) version 3.5 -- source code, tools, 
offline-build and test scripts. This gives you everything you need
to run CLM in a offline mode with NCEP forcing data in place of a
modeled atmosphere. In order to run with stand-alone CAM or concurrent
CCSM -- you also need other component models which are NOT provided in
this release.

What is new in CLM3.5 (compared to CLM3.0)?

CLM3.5 is considerably different to CLM3.0, particularly with respect to its 
simulation of the hydrologic cycle. The modifications consist of new surface 
datasets based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
products (Lawrence and Chase 2007), an improved canopy integration scheme 
(Thornton and Zimmermann 2007), scaling of canopy interception 
(Lawrence et al. 2007), a simple TOPMODEL-based model for surface and 
sub-surface runoff (Niu et al. 2005), a simple groundwater model for 
determining water table depth (Niu et al. 2007), and a new frozen soil scheme 
(Niu and Yang 2006). Theree are four additional modifications. Three of these, 
an improved description of soil water availability, a resistance term to 
reduce excessive soil evaporation, and the introduction of a factor to 
simulate nitrogen limitation on plant productivity, can be categorized as new 
or improved parameterizations from the perspective of CLM3. The other may be 
categorized as fixing an algorithmically defective existing parameterization 
(correction to snowage calculation so that snowage increases monotonically) 
(Dickinson et al. 2006).

Additionally, a number of small problems or bugs have been corrected including 
a revision of RTM-subcycling and corrections to a few land-locked grid cells, 
a more efficient soil evaporation calculation based on PFT demand, and a fix 
to aggregation of LAI from high-resolution source data to CLM surface data.
