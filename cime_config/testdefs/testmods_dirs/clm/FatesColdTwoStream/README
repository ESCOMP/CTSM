Testing FATES two-stream radiation scheme is activated by switching the fates_rad_model
parameter from 1 to 2.  This is all that is needed, both radiation schemes
1) Norman and 2) two-stream use the same optical parameters.

fates_rad_model

Note that to avoid exceeding the filename string length maximum, the parameter
file generated on the fly is placed in the $SRCROOT/src/fates/parameter_files
directory.  This may still run into problems is the $SRCROOT string is too long.

Like the test with seed dispersal activation, the main downside of this method is
that this file will require a custom update for every fates parameter file API update.
Addressing CTSM issue #2126 will alleviate
this issue as it will provide the capability to build the fates parameter file on 
the fly which with the appropriate values for this test.
