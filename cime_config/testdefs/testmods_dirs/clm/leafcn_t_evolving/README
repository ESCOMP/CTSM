This points to an alternate params file with
leafcn_co2_slope = 30 (default = 0)
to confirm that the leafcn_t_evolving calculation doesn't fail.

When we added this test, slevis and ekluzek agreed to consolidate our custom paramfiles into one.
The first of the consolidated paramfiles is named ctsm60_ceta450_cn30_co2_slope30.c250326.nc.
