! This namelist tests turning all points to 'active'; the point of
! this is to make sure that all points in memory could conceivably
! become active in a dynamic landunit run without causing any
! trouble. This should be tested with a _D test.

! Note that we don't necessarily expect this to work with an initial
! conditions file that wasn't itself generated with all_active =
! .true., so we set CLM_FORCE_COLDSTART=on for this (in shell_commands)

all_active = .true.

! Also run urban landunits everywhere possible; while a bit different
! from all_active, this is a related idea, so we test it as part of the
! same test mod.
run_zero_weight_urban = .true.
