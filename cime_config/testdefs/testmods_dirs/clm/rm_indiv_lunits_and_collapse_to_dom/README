This test
1) Keeps landunits with areas exceeding the correspondng "toosmall_*" namelist
   thresholds and removes the rest
2) Collapses unmanaged pfts to the 2 dominant ones
3) Collapses urban landunits to the dominant landunit
4) Collapses all landunits to the two dominant ones

All this simplifies the gridcell representation so as to run faster.

NB: This test is testing the 10x15 resolution only.
