The purpose of this testmod directory is to trigger runtime
initialization self-tests. This runs a set of unit/integration tests
that apply at initialization.

We use cold start so that we can get through initialization faster,
since how we initialize the model is unimportant for these self-tests.
We also exit as early as possible to minimize the time spent.

There are other self_tests that need to be exercised in the model time stepping
and are done outside of these.
