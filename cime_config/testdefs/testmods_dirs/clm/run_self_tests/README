The purpose of this testmod directory is to trigger runtime
initialization self-tests. This runs a set of unit/integration tests
that apply at initialization.

We inherit the test-mod that sets up for testing and bypassing as much as possible for speed.

There are other self_tests that need to be exercised in the model time stepping
and are done outside of these.
