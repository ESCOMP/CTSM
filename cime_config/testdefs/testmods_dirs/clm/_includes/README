This directory contains testmods directories that are meant to be
included in other testmods directories, not used directly.

One reason for doing this is so that we can have testmods here that
apply science settings without including one of the testmods that is
typically included for setting output frequency (e.g., 'default' or
'monthly'). Then the testmods here can be included in other testmods
that use different output frequencies (e.g., daily vs. monthly) while
having the same science options.
