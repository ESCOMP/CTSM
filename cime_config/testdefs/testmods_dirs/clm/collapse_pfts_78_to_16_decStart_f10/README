This test reads 78-pft datasets (glcMEC_decrease happens to be similar but
reads 16-pft datasets). In this way, it tests the
new combination do_transient_crops = .true. and use_crop = .false. while
exercising the collapse2gencrop branch ability to collapse the full crop data
to clm's generic crops.

This test includes the settings of the decStart test so as to also test the
end-of-year transition since it's an IHist case and transient vegetation gets
updated every new year.

NB: This test is testing the 10x15 resolution only.
