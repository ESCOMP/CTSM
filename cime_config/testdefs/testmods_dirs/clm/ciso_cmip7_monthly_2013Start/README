This tests with the new CMIP7 Carbon isotope datasets as streams.

However, this uses the initial version of C14 and hence C14 is constant with the value
over the southern pole latitude band. When we can change answers the ignore-warning should
be removed and the CMIP7 defaults setup to use the streams rather than default to the
CMIP6 version.
