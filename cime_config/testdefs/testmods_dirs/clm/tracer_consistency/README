This test turns on water tracer consistency checks. This ensures that
water tracers are updated to stay in sync with bulk quantities.

As of now (2018-09-05), water tracers are not yet initialized properly
when starting from a restart file that did not itself have water tracers
on it. So we use cold start for this test.
