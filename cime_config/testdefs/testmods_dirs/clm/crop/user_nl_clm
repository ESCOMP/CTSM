! The main point of including this field is to test the SUM history field infrastructure
! This is in the crop testmods because this field is mainly useful in transient crop runs
! This is on history tape 2 because this field is not meaningful at the gridcell level

! Instantaneous crop variables (including per-sowing/per-harvest axes), per PFT.
! Note that, under normal circumstances, these should only be saved annually.
! That's needed for the mxsowings and mxharvests axes to make sense.
! However, for testing purposes, it makes sense to save more frequently.
