The main point of this testmod is to exercise the case where nlevgrnd <
nlevurb (connected with
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/674). If/when we have an
out-of-the-box configuration with nlevgrnd < nlevurb (such as the NWP
configuration once nlevurb = 10 is the standard) then we can remove this
test.

A secondary consideration is having a test that interpolates from a
configuration with nlevgrnd > nlevurb onto one with lower nlevgrnd and
nlevgrnd < nlevurb. But I don't think it's critical to maintain this
test just for that purpose - e.g., if we start having an out-of-the-box
configuration with nlevgrnd < nlevurb but where the finidat file also
has nlevgrnd < nlevurb, then I feel it will be okay to remove this test.
