This testmod provides an finidat file compatible with the current model
configuration, at f09 resolution.

This testmods directory is for running LII tests which compare the answers for a case where
initial condition interpolation is on (use_init_interp=T) to a case with it's off and ensures
they are exact. For the interpolated result to match uninterpolation, it needs to be a case that 
essentially needs no interpolation so it's at the same resolution as the initial condition 
file (finidat file). When surface datasets are changed, or the land-mask is changed, or an 
important change is made to model physics (for example where new fields are added to the restart
file) -- you'll need to update the initial conditions file in this test (finidat file in 
the user_nl_clm file). 

To update the initial conditions (finidat) file for this test:

(1) Run the LII test; the 'base' case should run to completion even if the
no_interp test fails.

(2) Copy the finidat_interp_dest.nc file from the 'base' case to the inputdata
space. Rename this to be similar to the name of the file pointed to in this
test's user_nl_clm file, but with a new creation date.

(3) Update this the user_nl_clm file in this directory to point to the new
finidat file.
