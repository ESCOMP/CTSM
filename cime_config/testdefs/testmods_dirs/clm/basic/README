This testmods directory is for tests where we want to use the
out-of-the-box output options, but still want the minimal changes that
we apply for nearly all tests.

("default" would probably be a good name for this, but we already use
"default" to mean "the standard output changes that are applied for most
tests" (adding some streams and fields, double precision, etc.). We may
want to consider renaming that one and using "default" for this one.)
