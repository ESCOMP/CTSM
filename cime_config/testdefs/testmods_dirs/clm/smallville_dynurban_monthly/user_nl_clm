! The flanduse_timeseries file was created with the following NCL script (a copy of this script is in cime_config/testdefs/testmods_dirs/clm/smallville_dynurban_monthly):
! /glade/p/cgd/tss/people/oleson/modify_surfdata/modify_smallville_with_dynurban.ncl
! The file used as a template is: 
! /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/lnd/clm2/surfdata_map/landuse.timeseries_1x1_smallvilleIA_hist_78pfts_simyr1850-1855_c160127.nc
! Key points are that urban area starts as 0, increases after the first year, then decreases after the second year.
! Medium density urban is set to zero to test the memory-saving behavior of PCT_URBAN_MAX.
! PCT_CROP is also changed so that PCT_URBAN + PCT_CROP <= 100. (Here, PCT_CROP increases and decreases at the same time as PCT_URBAN in order to exercise the simultaneous increase or decrease of two landunits, but that isn't a critical part of this test.)
! Note that the use of this file means that this testmod can only be used with the 1x1_smallvilleIA grid.
! Feb 23, 2022: Use updated file with HASURBAN replaced by PCT_URBAN_MAX
