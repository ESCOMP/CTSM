This test-mods turns on using the prescribed moisture streams file
(rather than prognosing it in the model). And it turns on the lai streams

The only resolution we currently have data for is f09, so this must be done
at 0.9x1.25 resolution. And it makes the most sense for present day and
Satellite Phenology (Sp).
