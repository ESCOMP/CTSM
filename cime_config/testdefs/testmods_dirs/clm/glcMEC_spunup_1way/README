This testmods directory is for running LII tests which compare the answers for a case where
initial condition interpolation is on (use_init_interp=T) to a case with it's off and ensures
they are exact. For the interpolated result to match uninterpolation, it needs to be a case that 
essentially needs no interpolation so it's at the same resolution as the initial condition 
file (finidat file). When surface datasets are changed, or the land-mask is changed, or an 
important change is made to model physics (for example where new fields are added to the restart
file) -- you'll need to update the initial conditions file in this test (finidat file in 
the user_nl_clm file). 

This testmods also turns off the glc two-way coupling. This is done so that
glacier areas are taken from the restart file rather than from
CISM. This is partly so that changes in CISM don't affect the test
results, but more importantly so that LII tests can pass even if CISM
changes. (GLC two-way coupling was off in the generation of the
initial conditions file used here, too.) (4-24-18: I *think* we'll be
able to turn two-way coupling on once
https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/340 is resolved, though I'm not
positive about that. However, if
https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/issues/2484 is done, then we'd need this
testmods to turn off comparison of cpl initial hist files if we have
two-way coupling on, since areas will differ in initialization between
the two cases.)

To update the initial conditions (finidat) file for this test:

(1) Run the LII test; the 'base' case should run to completion even if the
no_interp test fails.

(2) Copy the finidat_interp_dest.nc file from the 'base' case to the inputdata
space. Rename this to be similar to the name of the file pointed to in this
test's user_nl_clm file, but with a new creation date.

(3) Update this the user_nl_clm file in this directory to point to the new
finidat file.
