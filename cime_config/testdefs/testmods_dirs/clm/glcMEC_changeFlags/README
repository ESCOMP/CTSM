This testmods directory switches some glc_mec-related flags in CLM, in order to
test different branches than are tested with the default options.

It also turns off the feedback from CISM to CLM, to test that
option. For this piece of the test to be useful, it should be used in a
test that uses CISM rather than SGLC, and ideally should be in a test
where CISM's glacier areas change within the test (though that last
piece may not be strictly necessary, since the relevant logic will still
be exercised in the first time step of the run even with a non-evolving
CISM).
