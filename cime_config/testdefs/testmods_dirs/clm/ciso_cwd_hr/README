This points to an alternate params file with
ceta = 450 (default = 358)

The README used to say that the alternate paramfile contained
rf_cwdl2     = 0.5 (default 0)
rf_cwdl3_bgc = 0.5 (default 0)
but now 0.5 is the default.

The README also used to say:
The test outputs inactive history fields that would contain zeros
when running with the default params file and should be greater than zero
when running with the alternate params file.
