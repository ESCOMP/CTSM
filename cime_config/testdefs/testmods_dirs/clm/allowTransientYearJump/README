This testmod has changes that are needed in transient (e.g., HIST) tests that have a jump
in years relative to an initial conditions file. For example, this comes up in the ERI
test, where the hybrid run starts two years later than the initial run.

This testmod is meant to be a mix-in with other testmods (e.g.,
'clm-something--clm-allowTransientYearJump'), so it does not have an include of the
default testmod or any other testmods (it is assumed that any needed includes come from
the primary testmod of the test, and that this is just added on top of that).
