! The fsurdat and flanduse_timeseries files were created with the following script:
! tools/modify_input_files/modify_smallville.sh

! Key points are that lake area starts as 0, increases after the first year, then decreases after the second year.
! PCT_CROP is also changed so that PCT_LAKE + PCT_CROP <= 100. (Here, PCT_CROP increases and decreases at the same time as PCT_LAKE in order to exercise the simultaneous increase or decrease of two landunits, but that isn't a critical part of this test.)
! Note that the use of this file means that this testmod can only be used with the 1x1_smallvilleIA grid.
