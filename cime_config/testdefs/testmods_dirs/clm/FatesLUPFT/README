This test mod does not use cold start and is intended to 
be used in conjunction with a test workflow that provides
an initialization file.  Currently this is accomplished
by using the test mod in conjunction with the PVT
system test.  The PVT system test runs a FATES spin-up 
case using the use_fates_potentialveg mode and then
references the restart output to run a use_fates_lupft
transient mode case.
