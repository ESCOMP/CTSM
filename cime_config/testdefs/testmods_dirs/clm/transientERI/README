This testmod has changes that are needed in a transient (e.g., HIST) ERI test.

This testmod is meant to be a mix-in with other testmods (e.g.,
'clm-something--clm-transientERI'), so it does not have an include of the default testmod
or any other testmods (it is assumed that any needed includes come from the primary
testmod of the test, and that this is just added on top of that).
