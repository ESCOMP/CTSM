Testing capability to read/use lightning frequency & population density
datasets. Calculates lightning ignitions using the SPITFIRE
formulation and anthropogenic ignitions using the Li et al. 2012 formulation 
based on human population density implemented in CTSM-CN's fire model.

Testing does not include a separate test for reading/using a successful
ignitions dataset which uses the same format and units so handling
is the same until you're in subroutine area_burnt_intensity where for
"successful ignitions" the model selects
currentSite%FDI = 1.0_r8
cloud_to_ground_strikes = 1.0_r8
while for lightning the model can use values < 1 for both.

Lara Kueppers (UC-Berkeley) has access to a "successful ignitions"
dataset for California that has not been placed in the repository of
CTSM datasets as of 2020/6/6. That dataset can be used with the
following settings:

fire_method = 'spitfire'
fates_spitfire_mode = 3
stream_fldfilename_lightng = '.../data_UCB/observed/CA_monthly_ignition_number_1980-2016/ignition_1980_to_2016_monthly_20190801.nc'
stream_year_first_lightng = 1980
stream_year_last_lightng = 2016
model_year_align_lightng = 1980

where {...} = /fs/cgd/data0/slevis on izumi and /glade/work/slevis on cheyenne.
