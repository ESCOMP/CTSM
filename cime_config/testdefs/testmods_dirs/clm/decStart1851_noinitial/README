This testmods directory was created for the sake of the smallville transient
test case. We need to use a cold-start to avoid this error message:

ERROR : CLM build-namelist::CLMBuildNamelist::setup_logic_initial_conditions() :
using ignore_ic_date is incompatable with crop!

Once the above problem is fixed, we should stop doing a coldstart in this
testmods
