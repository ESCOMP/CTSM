"""Implementation of the CIME LILACSMOKE (LILAC smoke) test.

This is a CTSM-specific test. It tests the building and running of CTSM via LILAC. Compset
is ignored, but grid is important. Also, it's important that this test use the nuopc
driver, both for the sake of the build and for extracting some runtime settings. This test
should also use the lilac testmod (or a testmod that derives from it) in order to
establish the user_nl_ctsm file correctly.

Important directories under CASEROOT are:
- lilac_build: this contains the build and the runtime inputs for the lilac run
- lilac_atm_driver: this contains the build of the test driver as well as the run
  directory in which the test is actually run

Note that namelists for this test are generated in the build phase; they are NOT
regenerated when the test is submitted / run. This means that, if you have made any
changes that will impact namelists, you will need to rebuild this test.

Note that this test is tied to a specific resolution (10x15) and has a hard-coded domain
file for this resolution: see the setting of lnd_domain_file below.
