"""
Implementation of the CIME LGRAIN2 (Land 2-grain-pool) test.

This is a CTSM specific test: Verifies that we can allocate and use a second grain pool,
and that answers are identical to a run with a single grain pool. This is useful until we
have tests that include AgSys, which will exercise this capability more completely.

(1) do a run with a second grain pool
(2) do a standard run only a single grain pool

The reason for having the second grain pool in the first case (rather than the other way
around) is that this results in having a few extra fields present in the baselines.
