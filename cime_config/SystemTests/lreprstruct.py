"""
Implementation of the CIME LREPRSTRUCT (Land Reproductive Structure) test.

This is a CTSM specific test: Verifies that we can allocate and use a crop reproductive
structure pool, and that answers are identical to a run with a single reproductive grain
pool. This is useful until we have tests that include AgSys, which will exercise this
capability more completely.

(1) do a run with a second grain pool and two reproductive structure pools, with all
    allocation going to the second reproductive structure pool
(2) do a standard run only a single grain pool, but with no crop seed replenishment

The reason for having the new reproductive structure pools in the first case (rather than
the other way around) is that this results in having a few extra fields present in the
baselines.
