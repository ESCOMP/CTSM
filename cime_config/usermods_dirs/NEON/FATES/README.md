# NEON user mods directories for FATES runs

Use these user mods as you would any other user_mods, e.g.:

`./create_newcase --case FATES_ABBY_test --res CLM_USRDAT --compset I1PtClm51Fates --run-unsupported --user-mods-dir /glade/work/$user/CTSM/cime_config/usermods_dirs/NEON/FATES/ABBY`

## Note on crop sites KONA and STER

Currently you cannot run FATES at these sites because FATES does not have crops as of yet. We will add these sites back once this capability is available.
