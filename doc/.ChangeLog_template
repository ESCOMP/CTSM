Purpose of changes
------------------

[Fill this in with details]


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): [If none, remove this line]
CIME Issues fixed (include issue #): [If none, remove this line]

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID): [If none, remove this line]

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include github issue ID): [If none, remove this line]


Significant changes to scientifically-supported configurations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Does this tag change answers significantly for any of the following physics configurations?
(Details of any changes will be given in the "Answer changes" section below.)

    [Put an [X] in the box for any configuration with significant answer changes.]

[ ] clm5_0

[ ] clm4_5

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):

Substantial timing or memory changes: [For timing changes, can check PFS test(s) in the test suite]

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing:

Code reviewed by:


CTSM testing:

[... Remove before making master tag.  Available test levels:

    a) regular (must be run before handing off a tag to SEs and must be run
     before committing a tag)
    b) build_namelist (if namelists and/or build_system changed))
    c) tools (only if tools are modified and no CTSM source is modified)
    d) short (for use during development and in rare cases where only a small
          change with known behavior is added ... eg. a minor bug fix)
    e) doc (no source testing required)

... ]

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - 

  tools-tests (test/tools):

    cheyenne - 

  PTCLM testing (tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

     cheyenne - 

  regular tests (aux_clm):

    cheyenne ---- 
    hobart ------ 

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: 


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: 

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
