Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):

Substantial timing or memory changes:
[For timing changes, you should at least check the PFS test in the test
 suite, whether or not you expect timing changes: ensure that its run
 time has not increased significantly relative to the baseline.]


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing:


Testing summary:
----------------
[... Remove before making master tag.

Nearly all CTSM tags should undergo 'regular' (aux_clm) testing.
However, it occasionally makes sense to do more or less system testing;
here is guidance on different available levels of system testing:
    a) no system testing (for use when the only changes are ones that
                          have absolutely no impact on system runs; this
                          includes documentation-only tags, tags that
                          just change the tools or some python code that
                          does not impact system runs, etc.)
    b) minimal (for use in rare cases where only a small change with 
                known behavior is added ... eg. a minor bug fix. This
		might be to just run the "short" test list, or to run
		a single test. Whatever makes sense for the particular case.)
    c) regular (regular tests on normal machines if CTSM source is modified)
    d) release (regular tests plus the fates, ctsm_sci, mosart and rtm test lists
                and normally all of the ancillary tests (build-namelist, python, ptclm, etc.) 
		would be run as well)

In addition, various other tests of the tools, python and perl
infrastructure should be run when appropriate, as described below.

[Remove any lines that don't apply.]

 [PASS means all tests PASS; OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests (if CLMBuildNamelist.pm has changed):

    cheyenne - 

  tools-tests (test/tools) (if tools have been changed):

    cheyenne - 

  PTCLM testing (tools/shared/PTCLM/test): (if cime or cime_config are changed)
  (PTCLM is being deprecated, so we only expect this to be done on occasion)

    cheyenne - 

  python testing (if python code has changed; see instructions in python/README.md; document testing done):

    (any machine) - 

  regular tests (aux_clm: https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/System-Testing-Guide#pre-merge-system-testing):

    cheyenne ---- 
    izumi ------- 
  
  fates tests:
    cheyenne ---- 

  any other testing (give details below):

If the tag used for baseline comparisons was NOT the previous tag, note that here:


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  [ If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
    following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section).
    And always remove these three lines and parts that don't apply. ]

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: 

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
