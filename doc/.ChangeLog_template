Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):

Changes to documentation:

Substantial timing or memory changes:
[e.g., check PFS test in the test suite and look at timings, if you
expect possible significant timing changes]


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing:


Testing summary:
----------------
[... Remove before making master tag.

Nearly all CTSM tags should undergo 'regular' (aux_clm) testing.
However, it occasionally makes sense to do more or less system testing;
here is guidance on different available levels of system testing:
    a) no system testing (this would normally be something that would go to the b4b-dev branch)
    b) minimal (for use in rare cases where only a small change with
                known behavior is added ... eg. a minor bug fix. This
		might be to just run the "short" test list, or to run
		a single test. Whatever makes sense for the particular case.)
    c) python only (for use where the only changes are in the python directory:
                    run the python testing listed below)
    d) regular (regular tests on normal machines if CTSM source is modified)
    e) release (regular tests plus the fates, ctsm_sci, mosart and rtm test lists
                and normally all of the ancillary tests (build-namelist, python, etc.)
		            would be run as well)

In addition, various other tests of the tools, python and namelist script
infrastructure should be run when appropriate, as described below.

[Remove any lines that don't apply.]

 [PASS means all tests PASS; OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests (if CLMBuildNamelist.pm has changed):

    derecho -

  python testing (if python code has changed; see instructions in python/README.md; document testing done):

    (any machine) -

    [If python code has changed and you are NOT running aux_clm (e.g., because the only changes are in python
     code) then also run the clm_pymods test suite; this is a small subset of aux_clm that runs the system
     tests impacted by python changes. The best way to do this, if you expect no changes from the last tag in
     either model output or namelists, is: create sym links pointing to the last tag's baseline directory,
     named with the upcoming tag; then run the clm_pymods test suite comparing against these baselines but NOT
     doing their own baseline generation. If you are already running the full aux_clm then you do NOT need to
     separately run the clm_pymods test suite, and you can remove the following line.]

    clm_pymods test suite on derecho - 

  regular tests (aux_clm: https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/System-Testing-Guide#pre-merge-system-testing):

    derecho -----
    izumi -------

  fates tests: (give name of baseline if different from CTSM tagname, normally fates baselines are fates-<FATES TAG>-<CTSM TAG>)
    derecho -----
    izumi -------

  any other testing (give details below):

  ctsm_sci
     derecho ----

If the tag used for baseline comparisons was NOT the previous tag, note that here:


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  [ If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
    following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section).
    And always remove these three lines and parts that don't apply. ]

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? Roundoff differences means one or more lines of code change results
   only by roundoff level (because order of operation changes for example). Roundoff
   changes to state fields usually grow to greater than roundoff as the simulation progresses.

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename:

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
