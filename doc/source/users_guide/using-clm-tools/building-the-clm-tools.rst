 Building the CLM tools

The tools **cprnc** and **gen_domain** use the CIME configure/build system which is described in the next section.

The only CLM FORTRAN tool is mksurfdata_esmf which has it's own build system that takes advantage of the cime build.

 Building the CLM tools that use the CIME configure/build system
================================================================

**cprnc** and *gen_domain** both use the CIME configure/build system rather than the CLM specific version described above.

See `CIME documentation on adding grids <http://esmci.github.io/cime/users_guide/grids.html?highlight=gen_domain#adding-grids>`_ for more information on adding grids, creating mapping files, and running **gen_domain**. Also see the CIME file: ``$CTSMROOT/tools/mapping/gen_domain_files/INSTALL`` for how to build **gen_domain**.
