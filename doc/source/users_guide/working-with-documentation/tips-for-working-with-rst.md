# Tips for working with reStructuredText

.. _rst-math:

## reStructuredText: Math
You can write inline math like ``:math:`y = mx + b``` → :math:`y = mx + b`. You can also write bigger equations on their own line that will automatically be numbered:

```reStructuredText
.. math::
  :label: equation for a line

  y = mx + b
```
.. math::
  :label: equation for a line

  y = mx + b

Note (a) the leading spaces for each line after `.. math::` and (b) the empty line after the label. If you don't include the `:label:` line, the equation will not be numbered.

reStructuredText math largely follows LaTeX syntax.

Common errors:
- 'ERROR: Error in "math" directive: invalid option block': You might have forgotten the empty line after your equation label.
- "WARNING: Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent": You might have forgotten the leading spaces for every line after `.. math::`. You need at least one leading space on each line.

.. _rst-cross-references:

## reStructuredText: Cross-references
reStructuredText lets you define labels that can be cross-referenced as links elsewhere in the documentation. A label looks like ``.. _this-is-my-label:`` or ``.. _This is my label with CAPS and spaces:``, on its own line surrounded by blank lines. The leading ``.. _`` and trailing ``:`` are what tell rST "this line is a label." E.g.:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

.. _this-is-my-label:

My cool information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
```

You could then refer to that section with ``:XYZ:`this-is-my-label``` (leaving off the leading `.. _`), where `XYZ` can be `ref`, `numref`, or `eq` (see examples below). This will create a link that, when clicked, takes the reader to the "My cool information" section.

Here are some examples. Note that the displayed link text will update automatically as needed (e.g., a section number or figure caption gets changed).
- Section headings, text: ``:ref:`rst-cross-references``` → :ref:`rst-cross-references`
- Section headings, number: ``:numref:`rst-cross-references``` → :numref:`rst-cross-references`. Note that, unlike `numref` for other things mentioned here, "Section" is not automatically prepended to the section number in the link text.
- Table, text: ``:ref:`crop-plant-functional-types``` → :ref:`crop-plant-functional-types`
- Table, number: ``:numref:`crop-plant-functional-types``` → :numref:`crop-plant-functional-types`
- Figure, text (uses entire caption): ``:ref:`CLM subgrid hierarchy``` → :ref:`CLM subgrid hierarchy`
- Figure, number: ``:numref:`CLM subgrid hierarchy``` → :numref:`CLM subgrid hierarchy`
- Equation, number: ``:eq:`equation for a line``` → :eq:`equation for a line`. The parentheses in the link text seem unavoidable, and there seems to be no way to refer to have the link show the label text or anything else aside from the number.

You can have any link (except for equations) show custom text by putting the referenced label at the end in `<angled brackets>`. E.g., ``:ref:`Diagram of CLM subgrid hierarchy<CLM subgrid hierarchy>``` → :ref:`Diagram of CLM subgrid hierarchy<CLM subgrid hierarchy>`. 

Note that this is necessary for labels that aren't immediately followed by a section heading, a table with a caption, or a figure with a caption. For instance, to refer to labels in our bibliography, you could do ``:ref:`(Bonan, 1996)<Bonan1996>``` → :ref:`(Bonan, 1996)<Bonan1996>`.

Common errors:
- "WARNING: Failed to create a cross reference. A title or caption not found": This probably means you tried to `:ref:` a label that's not immediately followed by (a) a table/figure with a caption or section or (b) a section (see above).
- "WARNING: undefined label": If you're sure the label you referenced actually exists, this probably means you tried to ``:numref:`` a label that's not immediately followed by a table, figure, or section (see above). Alternatively, you might have tried to ``:ref:`` an :ref:`equation<rst-math>`; in that case, use ``:eq:`` instead.
- "WARNING: malformed hyperlink target": You may have forgotten the trailing `:` on a label line.
- If you forget to surround a label with blank lines, you will get errors like "Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent [docutils]" that often point to lines far away from the actual problem.

.. _rst-comments:

## reStructuredText: Comments
If you want to add some text that's only visible in the documentation source file, you can use the reStructuredText comment syntax:

```
..
  This will not appear on the webpage or even anywhere in the generated HTML.

```

Make sure to include at least one empty line after the comment text.


## reStructuredText: Tables
Tables defined with the [:table: directive](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table) can be annoying because they're very sensitive to the cells inside them being precisely the right widths, as defined by the first `====` strings. If you don't get the widths right, you'll see "Text in column margin" errors. Instead, define your tables using the [list-table](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#list-table) directive.

If you already have a table in some other format, like comma-separated values (CSV), you may want to check out the R package [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html). Its [kable](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) command allows automatic conversion of R dataframes to tables in reStructuredText and other formats.
