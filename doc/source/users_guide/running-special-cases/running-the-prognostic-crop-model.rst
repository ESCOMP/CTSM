===================================
 Running the prognostic crop model
===================================

The prognostic crop model is setup to work with CLM4.0, CLM4.5 or |version| with either BGC or CN (with or without DV).
In order to use the initial condition file, we need to set the ``RUN_TYPE`` to startup rather than ``hybrid`` since the compset for f19 sets up to use an initial condition file without crop active. 
To activate the crop model you can choose a compset that has "Crop" in the name such as "I1850Clm50BgcCropCru" or simply add 
"-crop" to ``CLM_BLDNML_OPTS`` (or for CLM4.0 add "-crop on" to ``CLM_CONFIG_OPTS``).

Example: Crop Simulation
------------------------------------
::

   > cd scripts
   > ./create_newcase -case CROP -res f19_g17_gl4 -compset I1850Clm50BgcCropCru 
   > cd CROP

   > ./case.setup

   # Now build and run normally
   > ./case.build
   > ./case.submit
