 What is a special case?
=========================

All of the following special cases  cases that take more than one step to do. 
The straightforward cases have compsets and/or build-namelist use-cases setup for them or require simple editing of a single-case. 
All of the cases here require you to do at least two simulations with different configurations, or require more complex editing of the case (changing the streams files).

.. note:: The cases in this chapter are more sophisticated and require more technical knowledge and skill than cases in previous chapters. The user should be very familiar with doing simple cases before moving onto the cases described here.
