 Spinning up the Satellite Phenology Model
===========================================

To spin-up the CLMSP model you merely need to run CLMSP for 50 simulation years starting from arbitrary initial conditions. 
You then use the final restart file for initial conditions in other simulations. 
Because, this is a straight forward operation we will NOT give the details on how to do that here, but leave it as an exercise for the reader. 
See the `Example 4-7 <CLM-URL>`_ as an example of doing this as the last step for CLMCN.
