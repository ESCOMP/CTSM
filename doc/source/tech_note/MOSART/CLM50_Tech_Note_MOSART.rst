.. _rst_River Transport Model (RTM):

Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART)
=================================================

.. _Overview MOSART:

Overview
---------

MOSART is a river transport model designed for applications across local,
regional and global scales :ref:`(Li et al., 2013b) <Lietal2013b>`. A 
major purpose of MOSART is to provide freshwater input for the ocean 
model in coupled Earth System Models. MOSART also provides an effective 
way of evaluating and diagnosing the soil hydrology simulated by land 
surface models through direct comparison of the simulated river flow 
with observations of natural streamflow at gauging stations 
:ref:`(Li et al., 2015a)<Lietal2015a>`.  Moreover, MOSART provides a 
modeling framework for representing riverine transport and transformation
of energy and biogeochemical fluxes under both natural and human-influenced
conditions ( :ref:`(Li et al., 2015b) <Lietal2015b>`.    

.. _Routing Processes:

Routing Processes
------------------

MOSART divides each spatial unit such as a lat/lon grid or watershed into
three categories of hydrologic units (as shown in 
:numref:`Figure MOSART conceptual diagram`): hillslopes
that convert both surface and subsurface runoff into tributaries,
tributaries that discharge into a single main channel, and the main channel
that connects the local spatial unit with upstream/downstream units through the
river network. MOSART assumes that all the tributaries within a spatial unit
can be treated as a single hypothetical sub-network channel with a transport
capacity equivalent to all the tributaries combined. Correspondingly, three
routing processes are represented in MOSART: 1) hillslope routing: in each
spatial unit, surface runoff is routed as overland flow into the sub-network
channel, while subsurface runoff generated in the spatial unit directly enters
the sub-network channel; 2) sub-network channel routing: the sub-network channel
receives water from the hillslopes, routes water through the channel and discharges
it into the main channel; 3) main channel routing: the main channel receives water
from the sub-network channel and/or inflow, if any, from the upstream spatial units,
and discharges the water to its downstream spatial unit or the ocean.

MOSART only routes positive runoff, although negative runoff can be generated
occasionally by the land model (e.g., :math:`q_{gwl}`). Negative runoff in any
runoff component including  :math:`q_{sur}`,  :math:`q_{sub}`,  :math:`q_{gwl}` 
is not routed through MOSART, but instead is mapped directly from the spatial unit 
where it is generated at any time step to the coupler.  
 
In MOSART, the travel velocities of water across hillslopes, sub-network and main
channel are all estimated using Manning’s equation with different levels of
simplifications. Generally the Manning’s equation is in the form of

.. math::
   :label: 14.1
   
   V = \frac{R^{\frac{2}{3}} S_{f}}{n}

where  :math:`V` is the travel velocity (m s :sup:`-1` ),  :math:`R` is the hydraulic
radius (m). :math:`S_{f}`  is the friction slope that accounts for the effects
of gravity, friction, inertia and other forces on the water. If the channel slope
is steep enough, the gravity force dominates over the others so one can approximate
:math:`S_{f}` by the channel bed slope :math:`S` , which is the key assumption
underpinning the kinematic wave method. :math:`n`  is the Manning’s roughness
coefficient, which is mainly controlled by surface roughness and sinuosity of the 
flow path. 

If the water surface is sufficiently large or the water depth :math:`h` is
sufficiently shallow, the hydraulic radius can be approximated by the water depth.
This is the case for both hillslope and sub-network channel routing. 

.. math::
   :label: 14.2
   
   R_{h} = h_{h}
   R_{t} = h_{t}

Here :math:`R_{h}` (m) and :math:`R_{t}` (m) are hydraulic radius for hillslope and
sub-network channel routing respectively, and :math:`h_{h}` (m) and :math:`h_{t}` 
(m) are water depth during hillslope and sub-network channel routing respectively.
   
For the main channel, the hydraulic radius is given by 

.. math::
   :label: 14.3
   
   R_{r} = \frac{A_{r}}{P_{r}}

where :math:`A_{r}` (m :sup:`2` ) is the wetted area defined as the part of the 
channel cross-section area below the water surface,  :math:`P_{r}` (m) is the 
wetted perimeter, the perimeter confined in the wetted area. 
 
For hillslopes, sub-network and main channels, a common continuity equation can 
be written as

.. math::
   :label: 14.4
   
   \frac{dS}{dt} = Q_{in} - Q_{out} + R


where :math:`Q_{in}` (m :sup:`3` s :sup:`-1` ) is the main channel flow from 
the upstream grid(s) into the main channel of the current grid, which is zero for 
hillslope and sub-network routing. :math:`Q_{out}` (m :sup:`3` s :sup:`-1` ) is 
the outflow rate from hillslope into the sub-network, from the sub-network into 
the main channel, or from the current main channel to the main channel of its 
downstream grid (if not the outlet grid) or ocean (if the current grid is the 
basin outlet).  :math:`R` (m :sup:`3` s :sup:`-1` ) is a source term, which 
could be the surface 
runoff generation rate for hillslopes, or lateral inflow (from hillslopes) into 
sub-network channel or water-atmosphere exchange fluxes such as precipitation 
and evaporation. It is assumed that surface runoff is generated uniformly 
across all the hillslopes. Currently, MOSART does not exchange water with 
the atmosphere or return water to the land model so its function is strictly 
to transport water from runoff generation through the hillslope, tributaries, 
and main channels to the basin outlets.  

.. _Numerical Solution MOSART:

Numerical Solution
----------------------------

The numerical implementation of MOSART is mainly based on a subcycling 
scheme and a local time-stepping algorithm. There are two levels of 
subcycling. For convenience, we denote :math:`T_{inputs}` (s), 
:math:`T_{mosart}` (s), :math:`T_{hillslope}` (s) and 
:math:`T_{channel}` (s) as the time steps of runoff inputs (from CLM 
to MOSART via the flux coupler), MOSART routing, hillslope routing, and 
channel routing, respectively. The first level of subcycling is between 
the runoff inputs and MOSART routing. If :math:`T_{inputs}` is 10800s 
and :math:`T_{mosart}` is 3600s, three MOSART time steps will be 
invoked each time the runoff inputs are updated. The second level of 
subcycling is between the hillslope routing and channel routing. This 
is to account for the fact that the travel velocity of water across 
hillslopes is usually much slower than that in the channels. 
:math:`T_{hillslope}` is usually set as the same as :math:`T_{mosart}`, 
but within each time step of hillslope routing there are a few time 
steps for channel routing, i.e., 
:math:`T_{hillslope} = D_{levelH2R} \cdot T_{channel}`. The local 
time-stepping algorithm is to account for the fact that the travel 
velocity of water is much faster in some river channels (e.g., with 
steeper bed slope, narrower channel width) than others. That is, for 
each channel (either a sub-network or main channel), the final time 
step of local channel routing is given as 
:math:`T_{local}=T_{channel}/D_{local}`.  :math:`D_{local}` is 
currently estimated empirically as a function of local channel slope, 
width, length and upstream drainage area. If MOSART crashes due to a 
numerical issue, we recommend increasing :math:`D_{levelH2R}` and, if 
the issue remains, reducing :math:`T_{mosart}`.  

.. _Parameters and Input Data:

Parameters and Input Data
---------------------------------

MOSART is supported by a comprehensive, global hydrography dataset at 0.5 
:sup:`o` resolution. As such, the fundamental spatial unit of MOSART is a 0.5 
:sup:`o` lat/lon grid.  The topographic parameters (such as flow direction, 
channel length, topographic and channel slopes, etc.) were derived using the 
Dominant River Tracing (DRT) algorithm (:ref:`Wu et al., 2011<Wuetal2011>` ; 
:ref:`Wu et al. 2012 <Wuetal2012>`). The DRT algorithm produces the topographic 
parameters in a scale-consistent way to preserve/upscale the key features of 
a baseline high-resolution hydrography dataset at multiple coarser spatial 
resolutions. Here the baseline high-resolution hydrography dataset is the 
1km resolution Hydrological data and maps based on SHuttle Elevation 
Derivatives at multiple Scales (HydroSHEDS) 
(:ref:`Lehner and Döll, 2004 <LehnerDoll2004>` ; 
:ref:`Lehner et al., 2008 <Lehneretal2008>`).  The channel geometry 
parameters, e.g., bankfull width and depth, were estimated from empirical 
hydraulic geometry relationships as functions of the mean annual discharge. 
The Manning roughness coefficients for overland and channel flow were 
calculated as functions of landcover and water depth. For more details 
on the methodology to derive channel geometry and the Manning’s roughness 
coefficients, please refer to 
:ref:`Getirana et al. (2012) <Getiranaetal2012>` . The full list of 
parameters included in this global hydrography dataset is provided in 
:numref:`Table MOSART Parameters`.  Evaluation of global simulations 
by MOSART using the aforementioned parameters is described in 
:ref:`Li et al. (2015b) <Lietal2015b>` .

Difference between CLM5.0 and CLM4.5
-------------------------------------

1. Routing methods: RTM, a linear reservoir method, is used in CLM4.5 for 
river routing, whilst in CLM5.0, MOSART is an added option for river routing 
based on the more physically-based kinematic wave method.

2. Runoff treatment: In RTM runoff is routed regardless of its sign so 
negative streamflow can be simulated at times. MOSART routes only non-negative 
runoff and always produces positive streamflow, which is important for 
future extensions to model riverine heat and biogeochemical fluxes.

3. Input parameters: RTM in CLM4.5 only requires one layer of a spatially varying
variable of channel velocity, whilst MOSART in CLM5.0 requires 13 parameters that 
are all available globally at 0.5 :sup:`o` resolution.

4. Outputs: RTM only produces streamflow simulation, whilst MOSART 
additionally simulates the time-varying channel velocities, channel water depth, and 
channel surface water variations.
