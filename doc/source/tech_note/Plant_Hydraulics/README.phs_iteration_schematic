Daniel Kennedy provided the original file,
phs_iteration_schematic.svg. This can be used to generate the html
documentation. Bill Sacks then converted it to pdf using Inkscape
(simply using "save as" and saving it as a pdf); the pdf is needed when
generating a pdf (since latexpdf cannot use svg files).

Note that the figure is referenced in the rst as
phs_iteration_schematic.*; each builder then uses the appropriate file
(svg or pdf as needed).
