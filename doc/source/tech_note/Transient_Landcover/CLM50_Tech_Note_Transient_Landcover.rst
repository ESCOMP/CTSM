.. _rst_Transient Landcover Change:

Transient Land Use and Land Cover Change
========================================

CLM includes a treatment of mass and energy fluxes associated with
prescribed temporal land use and land cover change (LULCC). The model
uses an annual time series of the spatial distribution of the natural
and crop land units of each grid cell, in combination with the
distribution of PFTs and CFTs that exist in those land units. Additional
land use is prescribed through annual crop-specific management of
nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation (described further in
:numref:`rst_Crops and Irrigation`), and through wood harvest on tree
PFTs. For changes in the distributions of natural and crop vegetation,
CLM diagnoses the change in area of the PFTs and CFTs on January 1 of
each model year and then performs mass and energy balance accounting
necessary to represent the expansion and contraction of the PFT and CFT
areas. The biogeophysical impacts of LULCC are simulated through changes
in surface properties which in turn impact the surface albedo,
hydrology, and roughness which then impact fluxes of energy, moisture
and momentum to the atmosphere under the altered
properties. Additionally, changes in energy and moisture associated with
changes in the natural and crop vegetation distribution are accounted
for through small fluxes to the river and atmosphere. The biogeochemical
impacts of LULCC are simulated through changes in CLM carbon pools and
fluxes (see also Chapter :numref:`rst_CN Pools`).

CLM can also respond to changes in ice sheet areas and elevations when
it is coupled to an evolving ice sheet model (in the CESM context, this
is the Community Ice Sheet Model, CISM; see also Chapter
:numref:`rst_Glaciers`). Conservation of water, energy, carbon and
nitrogen is handled similarly for glacier-vegetation transitions as for
natural vegetation-crop transitions.

.. _Transient land use and land cover data:

Annual Transient Land Use and Land Cover Data
---------------------------------------------

The changes in area over time associated with changes in natural and crop vegetation and
the land use on that vegetation are prescribed through a forcing dataset, referred to here
as the *landuse.timeseries* dataset. The *landuse.timeseries* dataset consists of an
annual time series of global grids, where each annual time slice describes the fractional
area occupied by all PFTs and CFTs along with the nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation
fraction of each crop CFT, and the annual wood harvest applied to tree PFTs. Changes in
area of PFTs and CFTs are performed annually on the first time step of January 1 of the
year. Wood harvest for each PFT is also performed on the first time step of the
year. Fertilizer application and irrigation for each CFT are performed at each model time
step depending on rules from the crop model. Fertilizer application rates are set
annually. The irrigation fraction is also set annually; irrigated crops are placed on
separate columns from their unirrigated counterparts, so changes in irrigated fraction
triggers the changes in subgrid areas discussed below (sections :numref:`Transient
landcover reconciling changes in area` and :numref:`Transient landcover mass and energy
conservation`).

As a special case, when the time dimension of the *landuse.timeseries* dataset starts at a
later year than the current model time step, the first time slice from the
*landuse.timeseries* dataset is used to represent the current time step PFT and CFT
fractional area distributions. Similarly, when the time dimension of the
*landuse.timeseries* dataset stops at an earlier year than the current model time step,
the last time slice of the *landuse.timeseries* dataset is used. Thus, the simulation will
have invariant representations of PFT and CFT distributions through time for the periods
prior to and following the time duration of the *landuse.timeseries* dataset, with
transient PFT and CFT distributions during the period covered by the *landuse.timeseries*
dataset.

.. _Transient landcover reconciling changes in area:

Reconciling Changes in Area
---------------------------

In the first time step of January 1, changes in land unit weights can
potentially come from two sources: Changes in the area of the crop land
unit come from the *landuse.timeseries* dataset (section
:numref:`Transient land use and land cover data`), and changes in the
area of the glacier land unit come from the ice sheet model. The areas
of other land units are then adjusted so that the total land unit area
remains 100%.

If the total land unit area of glaciers and crops has decreased, then
the natural vegetated landunit is increased to fill in the abandoned
land. If the total land unit area of glaciers and crops has increased,
then other land unit areas are decreased in a specified order until the
total is once again 100%. The order of decrease is: natural vegetation,
crop, urban medium density, urban high density, urban tall building
district, wetland, lake.

These rules have two important implications:

1. We always match CISM's glacier areas exactly, even if that means a
   disagreement with prescribed crop areas. This is needed for
   conservation when CISM is evolving in two-way-coupled mode.

2. For land units other than crop, glacier and natural vegetation, their
   areas can decrease (due to encroaching crops or glaciers), but can
   never increase. So, for example, if a grid cell starts as 5% lake,
   crops expand to fill the entire grid cell, then later crop area
   decreases, the lake area will not return: instead, the abandoned
   cropland will become entirely natural vegetation.

For all levels of the subgrid hierarchy (land unit, column and patch),
we only track net changes in area, not gross transitions. So, for
example, if part of a gridcell experiences an increase in glacier area
while another part of that gridcell experiences an equal decrease in
glacier area (in the same glacier elevation class), CLM acts as if there
were no changes. As another example, consider a gridcell containing
natural vegetation, crop and glacier. If there is a decrease in glacier
area and an equal increase in crop area, CLM will assume that the crop
expands into the old glacier area, and nothing happened to the natural
vegetation area. A more realistic alternative would be that the crop
expanded into natural vegetation, and natural vegetation expanded into
glacier. The final areas will be correct in these cases, but the
adjustments of carbon and nitrogen states (section :numref:`Transient
landcover carbon and nitrogen conservation`) will be less accurate than what
would be obtained with a full tracking of gross transitions.

.. _Transient landcover mass and energy conservation:

Mass and Energy Conservation
----------------------------

.. _Transient landcover water and energy conservation:

Water and Energy Conservation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When subgrid areas change, the water and energy states remain unchanged
on a per-area basis. This can lead to changes in the total gridcell
water and energy content.

For example, consider a gridcell with two columns: column 1 has a water
mass of 1 kg m\ :sup:`-2` and column 2 has a water mass of 2 kg m\
:sup:`-2` for a given water state variable, where these are expressed
per unit column area. If column 1 increases in area at the expense of
column 2, then column 1 will still have a water mass of 1 kg m\
:sup:`-2`, but now expressed over the new column area. This results in a
decrease in the total gridcell water content.

Water and energy are conserved by summing up the total water and energy
content of each gridcell before and after a change in area. Differences
in liquid and ice water content are balanced by liquid and ice runoff
terms, which can be either positive or negative. (Negative runoff is
effectively a withdrawal of water from the ocean.) Differences in energy
content are balanced by a sensible heat flux term, which again can be
either positive or negative. These balancing fluxes are spread evenly
throughout the following year.

There is a special case when a given crop column type newly comes into
existence - for example, when temperate corn first comes into existence
in a gridcell. In this case, the column's below-ground temperature and
water states are copied from the natural vegetated column in its
gridcell, so that these state variables begin in a close-to-spun-up
state. Other state variables (most of which spin up relatively quickly)
begin at their cold start initialization values. This initialization is
not necessary for the two other land unit types that currently can
grow - natural vegetation and glacier: Those land unit types are always
active, even when they have zero area on the gridcell, so their state
variables will be spun up immediately when they come into
existence. After this initialization, the conservation code described
above takes effect.

.. _Transient landcover carbon and nitrogen conservation:

Carbon and Nitrogen Conservation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of the long timescales involved with below-ground carbon and
nitrogen dynamics, it is more important that these state variables be
adjusted properly when subgrid areas change. Carbon and nitrogen
variables are adjusted with the following three-step process:

(1) Patch-level (i.e., vegetation) state variables are adjusted for any
    changes in patch areas; this may lead to fluxes into column-level
    (i.e., soil) state variables

(2) Column-level (i.e., soil) state variables are updated based on the
    fluxes generated in (1)

(3) Column-level (i.e., soil) state variables are adjusted for any
    changes in column areas

First, patch-level (i.e., vegetation) state variables are adjusted for
any changes in patch areas. This includes changes in column or land unit
areas, even if the relative proportions of each patch remain constant:
the relevant quantities are the patch weights relative to the
gridcell.

For a patch that decreases in area, the carbon and nitrogen density on
the remaining patch area remains the same as before (i.e., expressed as
g per m\ :sup:`2` patch area). Because the area has decreased, this
represents a decrease in total carbon or nitrogen mass (i.e., expressed
as g per m\ :sup:`2` gridcell area). The lost mass meets a variety of
fates: some is immediately lost to the atmosphere, some is sent to
product pools (which are lost to the atmosphere over longer time
scales), and some is sent to litter pools.

For a patch that increases in area, the carbon and nitrogen density on
the new patch area is decreased in order to conserve mass. This decrease
is basically proportional to the relative increase in patch
area. However, a small amount of seed carbon and nitrogen is added to
the leaf and dead stem pools in the new patch area.

Next, column-level (i.e., soil) state variables are updated based on any
fluxes to soil pools due to decreases in patch areas. This step is
needed so that any lost vegetation carbon and nitrogen is conserved when
column areas are changing.

Finally, column-level state variables are adjusted for any changes in
column areas. Similarly to patches, for a column that decreases in area,
the carbon and nitrogen density on the remaining column area remains the
same as before (i.e., expressed as g per m\ :sup:`2` column area). This
represents a decrease in total carbon or nitrogen mass on the gridcell,
and this lost mass is tracked for each gridcell. After these mass losses
are summed for all shrinking columns, they are distributed amongst the
growing columns in order to conserve mass. Thus, a growing column's new
carbon density will be a weighted sum of its original carbon density and
the carbon densities of all shrinking columns in its gridcell.

This operation makes some simplifying assumptions. First, as described
in section :numref:`Transient landcover reconciling changes in area`, we
only track net area changes, not gross changes. Second, we assume that
growing columns all grow proportionally into each of the shrinking
columns.

Non-vegetated land units (e.g., glacier) do not typically track soil
carbon and nitrogen. When columns from these land units initially
shrink, they are assumed to contribute zero carbon and
nitrogen. However, when they grow into previously-vegetated areas, they
store any pre-existing soil carbon and nitrogen from the shrinking
columns. This stored carbon and nitrogen will remain unchanged until the
column later shrinks, at which point it will contribute to the carbon
and nitrogen in the growing columns (exactly as would happen for a
vegetated column).

In contrast to water and energy (section :numref:`Transient landcover
water and energy conservation`), no special treatment is needed for
carbon and nitrogen states in columns that newly come into
existence. The state of a new column is derived from a weighted average
of the states of shrinking columns. This behavior falls out from the
above general rules.

Annual Transient Land Cover Dataset Development
----------------------------------------------------

This section describes the development of the *landuse.timeseries* dataset.
Development of this dataset involves the translation of
harmonized datasets of LULCC for the historical period and
for the different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) - Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Additionally, LULCC time
series are to be generated for the Last Millennium and the extension beyond 2100 experiments
of CMIP6.

LUH2 Transient Land Use and Land Cover Change Dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To coordinate the processing and consistency of LULCC data between 
the historical period (1850-2015) and the six 
SSP-RCP (2016-2100) scenarios derived from Integrated
Assessment Models (IAM), the University of Maryland and the University of New Hampshire
research groups (Louise Chini, George Hurtt, Steve
Frolking and Ritvik Sahajpal; luh.umd.edu) produced a new version of the Land Use Harmonized version 2 
(LUH2) transient datasets for use with Earth System Model simulations. The new data sets
are the product of the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP; https://cmip.ucar.edu/lumip) 
as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The historical component of the 
transient LULCC dataset has agriculture and urban 
land use based on HYDE 3.2 with wood harvest based on FAO, Landsat and other sources, for the period 850-2015. 
The SSP-RCP transient LULCC components (2015-2100) are
referred to as the LUH2 Future Scenario datasets. The LULCC information is provided at 0.25 degree grid resolution and includes
fractional grid cell coverage by the 12 land units of:

Primary Forest, Secondary Forest, Primary Non-Forest, Secondary Non-Forest,

Pasture, Rangeland, Urban,

C3 Annual Crop, C4 Annual Crop, C3 Perennial Crop, C4 Perennial Crop, and C3 Nitrogen Fixing Crop.

The new land unit format is an improvement on the CMIP5 LULCC
datasets as they: provide Forest and Non Forest information in combination with Primary and Secondary 
land; differentiate between Pasture and Rangelands for grazing livestock; and specify annual details 
on the types of Crops grown and management practices applied in each grid cell. Like the CMIP5 LULCC datasets Primary vegetation 
represents the fractional area of a grid cell with vegetation undisturbed by human activities. Secondary
vegetation represents vegetated areas that have recovered from some human disturbance; this could include 
re-vegetation of pasture and crop areas as well as primary vegetation areas that have been logged.
In this manner the land units can change through deforestation from Forested to Non Forested land and in the 
opposite direction from Non Forested to Forested land through reforestation or afforestation without going
through the Crop, Pasture or Rangeland states.

The LUH2 dataset provides a time series of land cover states as well as a transition matrices that describes
the annual fraction of land that is transformed from one land unit category to
another (e.g. Primary Forest to C3 Annual Crop, Pasture to C3 Perrenial Crop, etc.; Lawrence et al.
2016). Included in these transition matrices is the total conversion of one land cover type to another referred to
as Gross LULCC. This value can be larger than the sum of the changes in the state of a land unit from one time period
to the next known as the Net LULCC. This difference is possible as land unit changes can occur both from the land unit 
and to the land unit at the same time. An example of this difference occurs with shifting cultivation where Secondary Forest
can be converted to C3 Annual Crop at the same time as C3 Annual Crop is abandoned to Secondary Forest.

The transition matrices also provide harmonized prescriptions of wood harvest both in area of the grid cell harvested
and in the amount of biomass carbon harvested. The wood harvest biomass amount includes a 30% slash component inline with
the CMIP5 LULCC data described in (Hurtt et al. 2011). The harvest area and carbon amounts are prescribed for the five classes of:
Primary Forest, Primary Non-Forest,
Secondary Mature Forest, Secondary
Young Forest, and Secondary
Non-Forest.

Additional land use management is prescribed on the Crop land units for
nitrogen fertilization and irrigation equipped land. The fertilizer application and the the irrigation fraction is 
prescribed for each Crop land unit in a grid cell individually for each year of the time series. The wood harvest 
and crop management are both prescribed spatially on the same 0.25 degree grid as the land use class transitions. 

Representing LUH2 Land Use and Land Cover Change in CLM5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To represent the LUH2 transient LULCC dataset in CLM5, the annual fractional
composition of the twelve land units specified in the dataset needs to be
faithfully represented with a corresponding PFT and CFT mosaics of CLM. 
CLM5 represents the land surface as a hierarchy of sub-grid types:
glacier; lake;  urban; vegetated land; and crop land. The vegetated land is
further divided into a mosaic of Plant Functional Types (PFTs), while the crop land 
is divided into a mosaic of Crop Functional Types (CFTs). 

To support this translation task the CLM5 Land Use Data tool has been built that extends the
methods described in Lawrence et al (2012) to include all the new functionality of CMIP6 and CLM5 LULCC. 
The tool translates each of the LUH2 land units for a given year into fractional PFT and CFT values based on 
the current day CLM5 data for the land unit in that grid cell. The current day land unit descriptions are generated from 
from 1km resolution MODIS, MIRCA2000, ICESAT, AVHRR, SRTM, and CRU climate data products combined with reference year 
LUH2 land unit data, usually set to 2005. Where the land unit does not exist in a grid cell for the current
day, the land unit description is generated from nearest neighbors with an inverse distance weighted search
algorithm.
 
The Land Use Data tool produces raw vegetation, crop, and management data files which are combined with 
other raw land surface data to produce the CLM5 initial surface dataset and the dynamic
*landuse.timeseries* dataset with the CLM5 mksurfdata_map tool. The schematic of this entire process from
LUH2 time series and high resolution current day data to the output of CLM5 surface datasets from the 
mksurfdata_map tool is shown in Figure 21.2.

The methodology for creating the CLM5 transient PFT and CFT dataset is based on four
steps which are applied across all of the historical and future time series. 
The first step involves generating the current day descriptions of natural and managed vegetation PFTs at 
1km resolution from the global source datasets, and the current day description of crop CFTs at the 10km resolution
from the MIRCA 2000 datasets. The second step combines the current day (2005) LUH2 land units with the current
day CLM5 PFT and CFT distributions to get CLM5 land unit descriptions in either PFTs or CFTs at the LUH2 resolution of
0.25 degrees. The third step involves combining the LUH2 land unit time series with the CLM5 PFT and CFT descriptions
for that land unit to generate the CLM5 raw PFT and CFT time series in the *landuse.timeseries* file. At this point in the process
management information in terms of fertilizer, irrigation and wood harvest are added to the CLM5 PFT and CFT data
to complete the CLM5 raw PFT and CFT files. The final step is to combine these files with the other raw CLM5 surface
data files in the mksurfdata_map tool.
