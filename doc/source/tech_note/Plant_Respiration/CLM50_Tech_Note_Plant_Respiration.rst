Plant Respiration
=================
CLM5 includes changes to plant respiration including
 - A new leaf respiration algorithm based on Atkin et al. (2016)
 - A lower growth respiration coefficient, based on Atkin et al. (2017)

Autotrophic Respiration
----------------------------

The model treats maintenance and growth respiration fluxes separately,
even though it is difficult to measure them as separate fluxes (Lavigne
and Ryan, 1997; Sprugel et al., 1995). Maintenance respiration is
defined as the carbon cost to support the metabolic activity of existing
live tissue, while growth respiration is defined as the additional
carbon cost for the synthesis of new growth.

Maintenance Respiration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Atkin et al. (2016) propose a model for leaf respiration that is based on the leaf nitrogen content per unit area (:math:`NS_{narea}` (gN m :sup:`2` leaf), with an intercept parameter that is PFT dependant, and an acclimation term that depends upon the average temperature of the previous 10 day period :math:`t_{2m,10days}`, in Celsius. 

.. math::
   :label: 17.46)

   CF_{mr\_ leaf} =  i_{atkin,pft} + (NS_{narea}  0.2061) - (0.0402 (t_{2m,10days}))

The temperature dependance of leaf maintenance (dark) respiration is described in Chapter :numref:`rst_Stomatal Resistance and Photosynthesis`.

.. math::
   :label: 17.47) 

   CF_{mr\_ livestem} \_ =NS_{livestem} MR_{base} MR_{Q10} ^{(T_{2m} -20)/10}

.. math::
   :label: 17.48) 

   CF_{mr\_ livecroot} \_ =NS_{livecroot} MR_{base} MR_{Q10} ^{(T_{2m} -20)/10}

.. math::
   :label: 17.49) 

   CF_{mr\_ froot} \_ =\sum _{j=1}^{nlevsoi}NS_{froot} rootfr_{j} MR_{base} MR_{Q10} ^{(Ts_{j} -20)/10}

where :math:`MR_{q10}` (= 2.0) is
the temperature sensitivity for maintenance respiration,
:math:`T_{2m}` (:sup:`o`\ C) is the air temperature at 2m
height, :math:`Ts_{j}`* (:sup:`o`\ C) is the soil
temperature at level *j*, and :math:`rootfr_{j}` is the fraction
of fine roots distributed in soil level *j*.

 ========================  ============= 

Note that, for woody vegetation, maintenance respiration costs are not
calculated for the dead stem and dead coarse root components. These
components are assumed to consist of dead xylem cells, with no metabolic
function. By separating the small live component of the woody tissue
(ray parenchyma, phloem, and sheathing lateral meristem cells) from the
larger fraction of dead woody tissue, it is reasonable to assume a
common base maintenance respiration rate for all live tissue types.

The total maintenance respiration cost is then given as:

.. math::
   :label: 17.50) 

   CF_{mr} =CF_{mr\_ leaf} +CF_{mr\_ froot} +CF_{mr\_ livestem} +CF_{mr\_ livecroot} .

Growth Respiration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Growth respiration is calculated as a factor of 0.11 times the total
carbon allocation to new growth (:math:`CF_{growth}`, after allocating carbon for N acquisition, 
Chapter :numref:`rst_FUN`.) on a given timestep, based on construction costs
for a range of woody and non-woody tissues, with estimates of the growth
respiration flux revised downswards following  (Atkin et al. 2017). For new
carbon and nitrogen allocation that enters storage pools for subsequent
display, it is not clear what fraction of the associated growth
respiration should occur at the time of initial allocation, and what
fraction should occur later, at the time of display of new growth from
storage. Eddy covariance estimates of carbon fluxes in forest ecosystems
suggest that the growth respiration associated with transfer of
allocated carbon and nitrogen from storage into displayed tissue is not
significant (Churkina et al., 2003), and so it is assumed in CLM that
all of the growth respiration cost is incurred at the time of initial
allocation, regardless of the fraction of allocation that is displayed
immediately (i.e. regardless of the value of :math:`f_{cur}`,
section 13.5). This behavior is parameterized in such a way that if
future research suggests that some fraction of the growth respiration
cost should be incurred at the time of display from storage, a simple
parameter modification will effect the change. [1]_

.. [1]
   Parameter :math:`\text{grpnow}`  in routines CNGResp and  CNAllocation, currently set to 1.0, could be changed to a smaller
   value to transfer some portion (1 - :math:`\text{grpnow}` ) of the growth respiration forward in time to occur at the time of growth
   display from storage.
