Surface Heterogeneity and Data Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spatial land surface heterogeneity in CLM is represented as a nested
subgrid hierarchy in which grid cells are composed of multiple land
units, snow/soil columns, and PFTs (:numref:`Figure CLM subgrid hierarchy`). 
Each grid cell can have
a different number of land units, each land unit can have a different
number of columns, and each column can have multiple PFTs. The first
subgrid level, the land unit, is intended to capture the broadest
spatial patterns of subgrid heterogeneity. The current land units are
glacier, lake, urban, vegetated, and crop (when the crop model option is
turned on). The land unit level can be used to further delineate these
patterns. For example, the urban land unit is divided into density
classes representing the tall building district, high density, and
medium density urban areas.

The second subgrid level, the column, is intended to capture potential
variability in the soil and snow state variables within a single land
unit. For example, the vegetated land unit could contain several columns
with independently evolving vertical profiles of soil water and
temperature. Similarly, the managed vegetation land unit can be divided
into two columns, irrigated and non-irrigated. The default snow/soil
column is represented by 25 layers for ground (with up to 20 of these
layers classified as soil layers and the remaining layers classified as
bedrock layers) and up to 10 layers for snow, depending on snow
depth. The central characteristic of the column subgrid level is that
this is where the state variables for water and energy in the soil and
snow are defined, as well as the fluxes of these components within the
soil and snow. Regardless of the number and type of PFTs occupying space
on the column, the column physics operates with a single set of upper
boundary fluxes, as well as a single set of transpiration fluxes from
multiple soil levels. These boundary fluxes are weighted averages over
all PFTs. Currently, for lake and vegetated land units, a single column
is assigned to each land unit. The crop land unit is split into
irrigated and unirrigated columns with a single crop occupying each
column. The urban land units have five columns (roof, sunlit walls and
shaded walls, and pervious and impervious canyon floor) (Oleson et
al. 2010b). The glacier land unit is separated into up to 10 elevation
classes.

  Configuration of the CLM subgrid hierarchy.  Box in upper right shows hypothetical subgrid distribution for a single grid cell.  Note that the Crop land unit is only used when the model is run with the crop model active. Abbreviations: TBD – Tall Building District; HD – High Density; MD – Medium Density, G – Glacier, L – Lake, U – Urban, C – Crop, V – Vegetated, PFT – Plant Functional Type, Irr – Irrigated, UIrr – Unirrigated.  Red arrows indicate allowed land unit transitions.  Purple arrows indicate allowed patch-level transitions.  

The third subgrid level is referred to as the patch level. Patches can be PFTs or bare ground on the vegetated land unit
and crop functional types (CFTs) on the crop land unit.
The patch level is intended to capture the
biogeophysical and biogeochemical differences between broad categories
of plants in terms of their functional characteristics. On the vegetated
land unit, up to 16 possible PFTs that differ in physiology and
structure may coexist on a single column. All fluxes to and from the
surface are defined at the PFT level, as are the vegetation state
variables (e.g. vegetation temperature and canopy water storage). On the
crop land unit, typically, different crop types can be represented on each
crop land unit column (see Chapter :numref:`rst_Crops and Irrigation` for details).

In addition to state and flux variable data structures for conserved
components at each subgrid level (e.g., energy, water, carbon), each
subgrid level also has a physical state data structure for handling
quantities that are not involved in conservation checks (diagnostic
variables). For example, the urban canopy air temperature and humidity
are defined through physical state variables at the land unit level, the
number of snow layers and the soil roughness lengths are defined as
physical state variables at the column level, and the leaf area index
and the fraction of canopy that is wet are defined as physical state
variables at the PFT level.

The standard configuration of the model subgrid hierarchy is illustrated
in :numref:`Figure CLM subgrid hierarchy`. Here, only four PFTs are shown 
associated with the single
column beneath the vegetated land unit but up to sixteen are possible.
The crop land unit is present only when the crop model is active.

Note that the biogeophysical processes related to soil and snow require
PFT level properties to be aggregated to the column level. For example,
the net heat flux into the ground is required as a boundary condition
for the solution of snow/soil temperatures (Chapter :numref:`rst_Soil and Snow Temperatures`). This column
level property must be determined by aggregating the net heat flux from
all PFTs sharing the column. This is generally accomplished in the model
by computing a weighted sum of the desired quantity over all PFTs whose
weighting depends on the PFT area relative to all PFTs, unless otherwise
noted in the text.

.. _Vegetation Composition:

Vegetation Composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vegetated surfaces are comprised of up to 15 possible plant functional
types (PFTs) plus bare ground (:numref:`Table Plant functional types`). An 
additional PFT is added if 
the irrigation model is active and six additional PFTs are added if the 
crop model is active (Chapter :numref:`rst_Crops and Irrigation`). These 
plant types differ in leaf and stem optical properties that determine reflection,
transmittance, and absorption of solar radiation (:numref:`Table Plant functional type optical properties`), root
distribution parameters that control the uptake of water from the soil
(:numref:`Table Plant functional type root distribution parameters`), aerodynamic parameters that determine resistance to heat,
moisture, and momentum transfer (:numref:`Table Plant functional type aerodynamic parameters`), and photosynthetic
parameters that determine stomatal resistance, photosynthesis, and
transpiration (:numref:`Table Plant functional type (PFT) stomatal conductance parameters`, 
:numref:`Table Temperature dependence parameters for C3 photosynthesis`). The composition and abundance of PFTs
within a grid cell can either be prescribed as time-invariant fields
(e.g., using the present day dataset described in section 21.3.3) or can
evolve with time if the model is run in transient landcover mode
(Chapter :numref:`rst_Transient Landcover Change`).

.. _Vegetation Structure:

Vegetation Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vegetation structure is defined by leaf and stem area indices
(:math:`L,\, S`) and canopy top and bottom heights (:math:`z_{top}`,\ :math:`z_{bot}` ). 
Separate leaf and
stem area indices and canopy heights are prescribed or calculated for each PFT. Daily leaf 
and stem area indices are obtained from griddeddatasets of monthly values (section 
:numref:`Surface Data`). Canopy top and bottom heights for trees are from ICESat (:ref:`Simard et al. (2011) <Simardetal2011>`). 
Canopy top and bottom heights for short vegetation are obtained from gridded datasets but are invariant in space
and time and were obtained from PFT-specific values (:ref:`Bonan et al. (2002a) <Bonanetal2002a>`) (:numref:`Table Plant functional type canopy top and bottom heights`).
When the biogeochemistry model is active, 
vegetation state (LAI, SAI, canopy top and bottom heights) are calculated prognostically 
(see Chapter :numref:`rst_Vegetation Phenology and Turnover`).

.. _Phenology and vegetation burial by snow:

Phenology and vegetation burial by snow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the biogeochemistry model is inactive, leaf and stem area indices
(m\ :sup:`2` leaf area m\ :sup:`-2` ground area) are updated
daily by linearly interpolating between monthly values. Monthly PFT leaf
area index values are developed from the 1-km MODIS-derived monthly grid
cell average leaf area index of :ref:`Myneni et al. (2002) <Mynenietal2002>`, 
as described in :ref:`Lawrence and Chase (2007) <LawrenceChase2007>`. Stem area 
ndex is calculated from the monthly PFT leaf area index using the methods of 
:ref:`Zeng et al. (2002) <Zengetal2002>`. The leaf and stem area indices are 
adjusted for vertical burying by snow (:ref:`Wang and Zeng 2009 <WangZeng2009>`) 
as

.. math::
   :label: 2.1 

   A=A^{*} ( 1-f_{veg}^{sno} )

where :math:`A^{\*}` is the leaf or stem area before adjustment for
snow, :math:`A` is the remaining exposed leaf or stem area,
:math:`f_{veg}^{sno}` is the vertical fraction of vegetation covered by snow

.. math::
   :label: 2.2

   {f_{veg}^{sno} = \frac{z_{sno} -z_{bot} }{z_{top} -z_{bot} }         \qquad {\rm for\; tree\; and\; shrub}} \\ 
   {f_{veg}^{sno} = \frac{\min \left(z_{sno} ,\, z_{c} \right)}{z_{c} } \qquad {\rm for\; grass\; and\; crop}} 

where :math:`z_{sno} -z_{bot} \ge 0,{\rm \; }0\le f_{veg}^{sno} \le 1`, :math:`z_{sno}`  is the depth of snow (m) 
(Chapter :numref:`rst_Snow Hydrology`), and :math:`z_{c} = 0.2` is the snow depth when short vegetation is assumed to 
be completely buried by snow (m). For numerical reasons, exposed leaf and stem area are set to zero if less than 
0.05. If the sum of exposed leaf and stem area is zero, then the surface is treated as snow-covered ground.

.. _Vertical Discretization:

Vertical Discretization
----------------------------
..
 (this was taken from Initialization; is it still needed?
 Vegetated and glacier land units have fifteen vertical layers, while
 lakes have ten. For soil points, temperature calculations are done over
 all layers, :math:`N_{levgrnd} =15`, while hydrology calculations are
 done over the top ten layers, :math:`N_{levsoi} =10`, the bottom five
 layers being specified as bedrock. 

.. _Soil Layers:

Soil Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The soil column can be discretized into an arbitrary number of layers.  The default 
vertical discretization (:numref:`Table Soil layer structure`) uses 
:math:`N_{levgrnd} = 25` layers, of which :math:`N_{levsoi} = 20` are hydrologically and 
biogeochemically active.  The deepest 5 layers are only included in the thermodynamical 
calculations (:ref:`Lawrence et al. 2008 <Lawrenceetal2008>`) described in Chapter 
:numref:`rst_Soil and Snow Temperatures`.

The layer structure of the soil is described by the node depth, :math:`z_{i}`  
(m), the thickness of each layer, :math:`\Delta z_{i}`  (m), and the depths
at the layer interfaces :math:`z_{h,\, i}`  (m).

Depth to Bedrock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hydrologically and biogeochemically active portion of the soil column can be 
restricted to a thickness less than that of the maximum soil depth.  By providing 
a depth-to-bedrock dataset, which may vary spatially, the number of layers used 
in the hydrologic and biogeochemical calculations, :math:`N_{bedrock}`, may be 
specified, subject to the constraint :math:`N_{bedrock} \le N_{levsoi}`.

atmospheric model in coupled mode or from an observed dataset in land-only
mode (Chapter :numref:`rst_Land-Only Mode`). The land model then initiates a full set of
calculations for surface energy, constituent, momentum, and radiative
fluxes. The land model calculations are implemented in two steps. The
land model proceeds with the calculation of surface energy, constituent,
momentum, and radiative fluxes using the snow and soil hydrologic states
from the previous time step. The land model then updates the soil and
snow hydrology calculations based on these fluxes. These fields are
passed to the atmosphere (:numref:`Table Land model output to atmospheric model`). The albedos sent to the atmosphere
are for the solar zenith angle at the next time step but with surface
conditions from the current time step.

:sup:`1`\ The atmospheric reference height received from the
atmospheric model :math:`z'_{atm}`  is assumed to be the height above
the surface as defined by the roughness length :math:`z_{0}`  plus
displacement height :math:`d`. Thus, the reference height used for flux
computations (Chapter :numref:`rst_Momentum, Sensible Heat, and Latent Heat Fluxes`) 
is :math:`z_{atm} =z'_{atm} +z_{0} +d`. The
reference heights for temperature, wind, and specific humidity
(:math:`z_{atm,\, h}` , :math:`z_{atm,\, {\it m}}` ,
:math:`z_{atm,\, w}` ) are required. These are set equal
to\ :math:`z_{atm}` .

:sup:`2`\ CAM provides convective and large-scale liquid
and solid precipitation, which are added to yield total liquid
precipitation :math:`q_{rain}`  and solid precipitation
:math:`q_{sno}` .
However, in CLM5, the atmosphere's partitioning into liquid and solid
precipitation is ignored. Instead, CLM repartitions total precipitation
using a linear ramp. For most landunits, this ramp generates all snow
below :math:`0 \textdegree C`, all rain above :math:`2 \textdegree C`,
and a mix of rain and snow for intermediate temperatures. For glaciers,
the end points of the ramp are :math:`-2 \textdegree C` and :math:`0
\textdegree C`, respectively. Changes to the phase of precipitation are
accompanied by a sensible heat flux (positive or negative) to conserve
energy.

:sup:`3`\ There are 14 aerosol deposition rates required depending
on species and affinity for bonding with water; 8 of these are dust
deposition rates (dry and wet rates for 4 dust size bins,
:math:`D_{dst,\, dry1} ,\, D_{dst,\, dry2} ,\, D_{dst,\, dry3} ,\, D_{dst,\, dry4}` ,
:math:`D_{dst,\, \, wet1} ,D_{dst,\, wet2} ,\, D_{dst,wet3} ,\, D_{dst,\, wet4}` ),
3 are black carbon deposition rates (dry and wet hydrophilic and dry
hydrophobic rates,
:math:`D_{bc,\, dryhphil} ,\, D_{bc,\, wethphil} ,\, D_{bc,\, dryhphob}` ),
and 3 are organic carbon deposition rates (dry and wet hydrophilic and
dry hydrophobic rates,
:math:`D_{oc,\, dryhphil} ,\, D_{oc,\, wethphil} ,\, D_{oc,\, dryhphob}` ).
These fluxes are computed interactively by the atmospheric model (when
prognostic aerosol representation is active) or are prescribed from a
time-varying (annual cycle or transient), globally-gridded deposition
file defined in the namelist (see the CLM4.5 User’s Guide). Aerosol
deposition rates were calculated in a transient 1850-2009 CAM simulation
(at a resolution of 1.9x2.5x26L) with interactive chemistry (troposphere
and stratosphere) driven by CCSM3 20\ :sup:`th` century
sea-surface temperatures and emissions (:ref:`Lamarque et al. 2010<Lamarqueetal2010>`) for
short-lived gases and aerosols; observed concentrations were specified
for methane, N\ :sub:`2`\ O, the ozone-depleting substances (CFCs)
,and CO\ :sub:`2`. The fluxes are used by the snow-related
parameterizations (Chapters :numref:`rst_Surface Albedos` and :numref:`rst_Snow Hydrology`).

:sup:`4`\ The nitrogen deposition rate is required by the
biogeochemistry model when active and represents the total deposition of
mineral nitrogen onto the land surface, combining deposition of
NO\ :sub:`y` and NH\ :sub:`x`. The rate is supplied either
as a time-invariant spatially-varying annual mean rate or time-varying
for a transient simulation. Nitrogen deposition rates were calculated
from the same CAM chemistry simulation that generated the aerosol
deposition rates.

:sup:`5`\ Climatological 3-hourly lightning frequency at
:math:`\sim`\ 1.8\ :sup:`o` resolution is provided, which was
calculated via bilinear interpolation from 1995-2011 NASA LIS/OTD grid
product v2.2 (http://ghrc.msfc.nasa.gov) 2-hourly, 2.5\ :sup:`o`
lightning frequency data. In future versions of the model, lightning
data may be obtained directly from the atmosphere model.

Density of air (:math:`\rho _{atm}` ) (kg m\ :sup:`-3`) is also
required but is calculated directly from
:math:`\rho _{atm} =\frac{P_{atm} -0.378e_{atm} }{R_{da} T_{atm} }` 
where :math:`P_{atm}`  is atmospheric pressure (Pa), :math:`e_{atm}`  is
atmospheric vapor pressure (Pa), :math:`R_{da}`  is the gas constant for
dry air (J kg\ :sup:`-1` K\ :sup:`-1`) (:numref:`Table Physical constants`), and
:math:`T_{atm}`  is the atmospheric temperature (K). The atmospheric
vapor pressure :math:`e_{atm}`  is derived from atmospheric specific
humidity :math:`q_{atm}`  (kg kg\ :sup:`-1`) as
:math:`e_{atm} =\frac{q_{atm} P_{atm} }{0.622+0.378q_{atm} }` .

The O\ :sub:`2` partial pressure (Pa) is required but is
calculated from molar ratio and the atmospheric pressure
:math:`P_{atm}`  as :math:`o_{i} =0.209P_{atm}` .

.. _Initialization:

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initialization of the land model (i.e., providing the model with initial
temperature and moisture states) depends on the type of run (startup or
restart) (see the CLM4.5 User’s Guide). A startup run starts the model
from either initial conditions that are set internally in the Fortran
code (referred to as arbitrary initial conditions) or from an initial
conditions dataset that enables the model to start from a spun up state
(i.e., where the land is in equilibrium with the simulated climate). In
restart runs, the model is continued from a previous simulation and
initialized from a restart file that ensures that the output is
bit-for-bit the same as if the previous simulation had not stopped. The
fields that are required from the restart or initial conditions files
can be obtained by examining the code. Arbitrary initial conditions are
specified as follows.

Soil points are initialized with
surface ground temperature :math:`T_{g}`  and soil layer temperature
:math:`T_{i}` , for :math:`i=1,\ldots ,N_{levgrnd}` , of 274 K,
vegetation temperature :math:`T_{v}`  of 283 K, no snow or canopy water
(:math:`W_{sno} =0`, :math:`W_{can} =0`), and volumetric soil water
content :math:`\theta _{i} =0.15` mm\ :sup:`3` mm\ :sup:`-3`
for layers :math:`i=1,\ldots ,N_{levsoi}`  and :math:`\theta _{i} =0.0`
mm\ :sup:`3` mm\ :sup:`-3` for layers
:math:`i=N_{levsoi} +1,\ldots ,N_{levgrnd}` . placeLake temperatures
(:math:`T_{g}`  and :math:`T_{i}` ) are initialized at 277 K and
:math:`W_{sno} =0`.

Glacier temperatures (:math:`T_{g} =T_{snl+1}`  and :math:`T_{i}`  for
:math:`i=snl+1,\ldots ,N_{levgrnd}`  where :math:`snl` is the negative
of the number of snow layers, i.e., :math:`snl` ranges from –5 to 0) are
initialized to 250 K with a snow water equivalent :math:`W_{sno} =1000`
mm, snow depth :math:`z_{sno} =\frac{W_{sno} }{\rho _{sno} }`  (m) where
:math:`\rho _{sno} =250` kg m\ :sup:`-3` is an initial estimate
for the bulk density of snow, and :math:`\theta _{i}` \ =1.0 for
:math:`i=1,\ldots ,N_{levgrnd}` . The snow layer structure (e.g., number
of snow layers :math:`snl` and layer thickness) is initialized based on
the snow depth (section 6.1). The snow liquid water and ice contents (kg
m\ :sup:`-2`) are initialized as :math:`w_{liq,\, i} =0` and
:math:`w_{ice,\, i} =\Delta z_{i} \rho _{sno}` , respectively, where
:math:`i=snl+1,\ldots ,0` are the snow layers, and :math:`\Delta z_{i}` 
is the thickness of snow layer :math:`i` (m). The soil liquid water and
ice contents are initialized as :math:`w_{liq,\, i} =0` and
:math:`w_{ice,\, i} =\Delta z_{i} \rho _{ice} \theta _{i}`  for
:math:`T_{i} \le T_{f}` , and
:math:`w_{liq,\, i} =\Delta z_{i} \rho _{liq} \theta _{i}`  and
:math:`w_{ice,\, i} =0` for :math:`T_{i} >T_{f}` , where
:math:`\rho _{ice}`  and :math:`\rho _{liq}`  are the densities of ice
and liquid water (kg m\ :sup:`-3`) (:numref:`Table Physical constants`), and :math:`T_{f}` 
is the freezing temperature of water (K) (:numref:`Table Physical constants`). All vegetated and

Surface Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Required surface data for each land grid cell are listed in 
:numref:`Table Surface data required for CLM and their base spatial resolution`
and include the glacier, lake, and urban fractions of the grid cell
(vegetated and crop occupy the remainder), the fractional cover of each
plant functional type (PFT), monthly leaf and stem area index and canopy
top and bottom heights for each PFT, soil color, soil texture, soil
organic matter density, maximum fractional saturated area, slope,
elevation, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emissions
factors, population density, gross domestic production, peat area
fraction, and peak month of agricultural burning. Optional surface data
include crop irrigation and managed crops. All fields are aggregated to
the model’s grid from high-resolution input datasets (
:numref:`Table Surface data required for CLM and their base spatial resolution`) that
are obtained from a variety of sources described below.

At the base spatial resolution of 0.05\ :sup:`o`, the percentage of
each PFT is defined with respect to the vegetated portion of the grid
cell and the sum of the PFTs is 100%. The percent lake,
glacier, and urban at their base resolution are specified with respect
to the entire grid cell. The surface dataset creation routines re-adjust
the PFT percentages to ensure that the sum of all land cover types in
the grid cell sum to 100%. A minimum threshold of 0.1% of the grid cell
by area is required for urban areas.

The percentage glacier mask was derived from vector data of global
glacier and ice sheet spatial coverage. Vector data for glaciers (ice
caps, icefields and mountain glaciers) were taken from the first
globally complete glacier inventory, the Randolph Glacier Inventory
version 1.0 (RGIv1.0: :ref:`Arendt et al. 2012 <Arendtetal2012>`).
Vector data for the Greenland Ice Sheet were provided by Frank Paul and
Tobias Bolch (University of Zurich: :ref:`Rastner et al. 2012
<Rastneretal2012>`).  Antarctic Ice Sheet data were provided by Andrew
Bliss (University of Alaska) and were extracted from the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Antarctic Digital Database
version 5.0. Floating ice is only provided for the Antarctic and does
not include the small area of Arctic ice shelves. High spatial
resolution vector data were then processed to determine the area of
glacier, ice sheet and floating ice within 30-second grid cells
globally. The 30-second glacier, ice sheet and Antarctic ice shelf masks
were subsequently draped over equivalent-resolution GLOBE topography
(Global Land One-km Base Elevation Project, Hastings et al. 1999) to
extract approximate ice-covered elevations of ice-covered regions. Grid
cells flagged as land-ice in the mask but ocean in GLOBE (typically,
around ice sheets at high latitudes) were designated land-ice with an
elevation of 0 meters. Finally, the high-resolution mask/topography
datasets were aggregated and processed into three 3-minute datasets:
3-minute fractional areal land ice coverage (including both glaciers and
ice sheets); 3-minute distributions of areal glacier fractional coverage
by elevation and areal ice sheet fractional coverage by elevation. Ice
fractions were binned at 100 meter intervals, with bin edges defined
from 0 to 6000 meters (plus one top bin encompassing all remaining
high-elevation ice, primarily in the Himalaya). These distributions by
elevation are used to divide each glacier land unit into columns based
on elevation class.

When running with the CISM ice sheet model, CISM dictates glacier areas
and elevations in its domain, overriding the values specified by CLM's
datasets. In typical CLM5 configurations, this means that CISM dictates
glacier areas and elevations over Greenland.

Percent lake and lake depth are area-averaged from the 90-second
resolution data of :ref:`Kourzeneva (2009, 2010) <Kourzeneva2009>` to the 0.05\ :sup:`o`
resolution using the MODIS land-mask. Percent urban is derived from
LandScan 2004, a population density dataset derived from census data,
nighttime lights satellite observations, road proximity and slope
(:ref:`Dobson et al. 2000 <Dobsonetal2000>`) as described by 
:ref:`Jackson et al. (2010) <Jacksonetal2010>` at 1km
resolution and aggregated to 0.05\ :sup:`o`. A number of urban
radiative, thermal, and morphological fields are also required and are
obtained from :ref:`Jackson et al. (2010) <Jacksonetal2010>`. Their description can be found in
Table 3 of the Community Land Model Urban (CLMU) technical note (:ref:`Oleson
et al. 2010b <Olesonetal2010b>`).

Percent PFTs are derived from MODIS satellite data as described in
:ref:`Lawrence and Chase (2007) <LawrenceChase2007>` (section 21.3.3). 
Prescribed PFT leaf area index is derived from the MODIS satellite data of 
:ref:`Myneni et al. (2002) <Mynenietal2002>` using the de-aggregation methods 
described in :ref:`Lawrence and Chase (2007) <LawrenceChase2007>`
(section 2.2.3). Prescribed PFT stem area index is derived from PFT leaf
area index phenology combined with the methods of :ref:`Zeng et al. (2002) <Zengetal2002>`.
Prescribed canopy top and bottom heights are from :ref:`Bonan (1996) <Bonan1996>` as
described in :ref:`Bonan et al. (2002b) <Bonanetal2002b>`. If the biogeochemistry model is
active, it supplies the leaf and stem area index and canopy top and
bottom heights dynamically, and the prescribed values are ignored.

Soil color determines dry and saturated soil albedo (section :numref:`Ground Albedos`). 
Soil colors are from :ref:`Lawrence and Chase (2007) <LawrenceChase2007>`.

The soil texture and organic matter content determine soil thermal and
hydrologic properties (sections 6.3 and 7.4.1). The International
Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) soil dataset (Global Soil Data Task
2000) of 4931 soil mapping units and their sand and clay content for
each soil layer were used to create a mineral soil texture dataset
:ref:`(Bonan et al. 2002b) <Bonanetal2002b>`. Soil organic matter data is merged from two
sources. The majority of the globe is from ISRIC-WISE (:ref:`Batjes, 2006 <Batjes2006>`).
The high latitudes come from the 0.25\ :sup:`o` version of the
Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (:ref:`Hugelius et al. 2012 <Hugeliusetal2012>`). Both
datasets report carbon down to 1m depth. Carbon is partitioned across
the top seven CLM4 layers (:math:`\sim`\ 1m depth) as in 
:ref:`Lawrence and Slater (2008) <LawrenceSlater2008>`.

The maximum fractional saturated area (:math:`f_{\max }` ) is used in
determining surface runoff and infiltration (section 7.3). Maximum
fractional saturated area at 0.125\ :sup:`o` resolution is
calculated from 1-km compound topographic indices (CTIs) based on the
USGS HYDRO1K dataset (:ref:`Verdin and Greenlee 1996 <VerdinGreenlee1996>`) 
following the algorithm in :ref:`Niu et al. (2005) <Niuetal2005>`. 
:math:`f_{\max }`  is the ratio between the number
of 1-km pixels with CTIs equal to or larger than the mean CTI and the
total number of pixels in a 0.125\ :sup:`o` grid cell. See
section 7.3.1 and :ref:`Li et al. (2013b) <Lietal2013b>` for further details. Slope and
elevation are also obtained from the USGS HYDRO1K 1-km dataset 
(:ref:`Verdin and Greenlee 1996 <VerdinGreenlee1996>`).  Slope is used in the 
surface water parameterization (section :numref:`Surface Water Storage`), and
elevation is used to calculate the grid cell standard deviation of
topography for the snow cover fraction parameterization (section :numref:`Snow Covered Area Fraction`).

Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds emissions factors are from the Model
of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1;
:ref:`Guenther et al. 2012 <Guentheretal2012>`).

The default list of PFTs includes an unmanaged crop treated as a second
C3 grass (:numref:`Table Plant functional types`). The unmanaged crop has grid cell fractional cover
assigned from MODIS satellite data (:ref:`Lawrence and Chase (2007) <LawrenceChase2007>`). A managed
crop option uses grid cell fractional cover from the present-day crop
dataset of :ref:`Ramankutty and Foley (1998) <RamankuttyFoley1998>` 
(CLM4CNcrop). Managed crops are assigned in the proportions given by 
:ref:`Ramankutty and Foley (1998) <RamankuttyFoley1998>` without
exceeding the area previously assigned to the unmanaged crop. The
unmanaged crop continues to occupy any of its original area that remains
and continues to be handled just by the CN part of CLM4CNcrop. The
managed crop types (corn, soybean, and temperate cereals) were chosen
based on the availability of corresponding algorithms in AgroIBIS
(:ref:`Kucharik et al. 2000 <Kuchariketal2000>`; 
:ref:`Kucharik and Brye 2003 <KucharikBrye2003>`). Temperate cereals
include wheat, barley, and rye here. All temperate cereals are treated
as summer crops (like spring wheat, for example) at this time. Winter
cereals (such as winter wheat) may be introduced in a future version of
the model.

To allow crops to coexist with natural vegetation in a grid cell and be
treated by separate models (i.e., CLM4.5BGCcrop versus the Dynamic
Vegetation version (CLM4.5BGCDV)), we separate the vegetated land unit
into a naturally vegetated land unit and a human managed land unit. PFTs
in the naturally vegetated land unit share one soil column and compete
for water (default CLM setting). PFTs in the human managed land unit do
not share soil columns and thus permit for differences in land
management between crops.

CLM includes the option to irrigate cropland areas that are equipped for
irrigation. The application of irrigation responds dynamically to climate 
(see Chapter :numref:`rst_Crops and Irrigation`). In CLM, irrigation is 
implemented for the C3 generic crop only. When irrigation is enabled, the 
cropland area of each grid cell is divided into an irrigated and unirrigated 
fraction according to a dataset of areas equipped for irrigation 
(:ref:`Siebert et al. (2005) <Siebertetal2005>`). The area of irrigated 
cropland in each grid cell is given by the
smaller of the grid cell’s total cropland area, according to the default
CLM4 dataset, and the grid cell’s area equipped for irrigation. The
remainder of the grid cell’s cropland area (if any) is then assigned to
unirrigated cropland. Irrigated and unirrigated crops are placed on
separate soil columns, so that irrigation is only applied to the soil
beneath irrigated crops.

Several input datasets are required for the fire model (:ref:`Li et al. 2013a <Lietal2013a>`)
including population density, gross domestic production, peat area
fraction, and peak month of agricultural waste burning. Population
density at 0.5\ :sup:`o` resolution for 1850-2100 combines 5-min
resolution decadal population density data for 1850–1980 from the
Database of the Global Environment version 3.1 (HYDEv3.1) with
0.5\ :sup:`o` resolution population density data for 1990, 1995,
2000, and 2005 from the Gridded Population of the World version 3
dataset (GPWv3) (CIESIN, 2005). Gross Domestic Production (GDP) per
capita in 2000 at 0.5\ :sup:`o` is from :ref:`Van Vuuren et al. (2006) <VanVuurenetal2006>`,
which is the base-year GDP data for IPCC-SRES and derived from
country-level World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) measured
in constant 1995 US$ (:ref:`World Bank, 2004 <WorldBank2004>`) and the UN Statistics Database
(:ref:`UNSTAT, 2005 <UNSTAT2005>`). The peatland area fraction at 0.5\ :sup:`o`
resolution is derived from three vector datasets: peatland data in
Indonesia and Malaysian Borneo (:ref:`Olson et al. 2001 <Olsonetal2001>`); peatland data in
Canada (:ref:`Tarnocai et al. 2011 <Tarnocaietal2011>`); and bog, fen and mire data in boreal
regions (north of 45\ :sup:`o`\ N) outside Canada provided by the
Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) (:ref:`Lehner and Döll, 2004 <LehnerDoll2004>`). The
climatological peak month for agricultural waste burning is from :ref:`van der
Werf et al. (2010) <vanderWerfetal2010>`.
