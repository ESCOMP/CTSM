Summary of CLM5.0 updates relative to CLM4.5
-----------------------------------------------------

We describe external inputs to the nitrogen cycle in CLM5.0.  Much of the following information appeared in the CLM4.5 Technical Note (:ref:`Oleson et al. 2013 <Olesonetal2013>`) as well as :ref:`Koven et al. (2013) <Kovenetal2013>`.

CLM5.0 includes the following changes to terrestrial nitrogen inputs:

- Time varrying deposition of reactive nitrogen. In off-line runs this changes monthly. In coupled simulations N deposition is passed at the coupling timestep (e.g., half-hourly).

- Asymbiotic (or free living) N fixation is a function of evapotranspiration and is added to the inorganic nitrogen (NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+`) pool (described below).

- Symbiotic N fixation is handled by the FUN model (chapter :numref:`rst_FUN`) and is passed straight to the plant, not the mineral nitrogen pool.

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------

In addition to the relatively rapid cycling of nitrogen within the plant
– litter – soil organic matter system, CLM also represents several
processes which couple the internal nitrogen cycle to external sources
and sinks. Inputs of new mineral nitrogen are from atmospheric
deposition and biological nitrogen fixation. Losses of mineral nitrogen
are due to nitrification, denitrification, leaching, and losses in fire.
While the short-term dynamics of nitrogen limitation depend on the
behavior of the internal nitrogen cycle, establishment of total
ecosystem nitrogen stocks depends on the balance between sources and
sinks in the external nitrogen cycle (:ref:`Thomas et al. 2015 <Thomasetal2015>`).

As with CLM4.5, CLM5.0 represents inorganic N transformations based on the Century N-gas model; this
includes separate NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` and
NO\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-` pools, as well as
environmentally controlled nitrification and denitrification rates that is described below.

Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition
------------------------------------

CLM uses a single variable to represent the total deposition of mineral
nitrogen onto the land surface, combining wet and dry deposition of
NO\ :sub:`y` and NH\ :sub:`x` as a single flux
(:math:`{NF}_{ndep\_sminn}`, gN m\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1`). This flux 
is intended to represent total reactive
nitrogen deposited to the land surface which originates from the
following natural and anthropogenic sources (Galloway et al. 2004):
formation of NO\ :sub:`x` during lightning,
NO\ :math:`{}_{x }`\ and NH\ :sub:`3` emission from wildfire,
NO\ :sub:`x` emission from natural soils, NH\ :sub:`3`
emission from natural soils, vegetation, and wild animals,
NO\ :sub:`x` and NH\ :sub:`3` emission during fossil fuel
combustion (both thermal and fuel NO\ :sub:`x` production),
NO\ :sub:`x` and NH\ :sub:`3` emission from other industrial
processes, NO\ :sub:`x` and NH\ :sub:`3` emission from fire
associated with deforestation, NO\ :sub:`x` and NH\ :sub:`3`
emission from agricultural burning, NO\ :sub:`x` emission from
agricultural soils, NH\ :sub:`3` emission from agricultural crops,
NH\ :sub:`3` emission from agricultural animal waste, and
NH\ :sub:`3` emission from human waste and waste water. The
deposition flux is provided as a spatially and (potentially) temporally
varying dataset (see section :numref:`Atmospheric Coupling` for a description of the default
input dataset).

The nitrogen deposition flux is assumed to enter the NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` pool, 
and is vertically distributed throughout the soil profile. Although N deposition 
inputs include both oxidized and reduced forms, CLM5 only reads in total 
N deposition. This approach is held over from CLM4.0, which only represented a 
single mineral nitrogen pool, however, real pathways for wet and dry
nitrogen deposition can be more complex than currently represented in
the CLM5.0, including release from melting snowpack and direct foliar
uptake of deposited NO\ :sub:`y` (:ref:`Tye et al. 2005 <Tyeetal2005>`; 
:ref:`Vallano and Sparks, 2007 <VallanoSparks2007>`). 

In offline (uncoupled) CLM5.0 simulations monthly 
estimates of N deposition are provided, as opposed to decadal files 
supplied with previous versions of the model. In coupled simulations,
N depositions fluxes are passed to the land model at the frequency of 
the time step (every half hour) through the coupler.  


Biological Nitrogen Fixation
---------------------------------

The fixation of new reactive nitrogen from atmospheric N\ :sub:`2`
by soil microorganisms is an important component of both preindustrial
and modern-day nitrogen budgets, but a mechanistic understanding of
global-scale controls on biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is still
only poorly developed (:ref:`Cleveland et al. 1999 <Clevelandetal1999>`;
:ref:`Galloway et al. 2004 <Gallowayetal2004>`). CLM5.0 uses the FUN 
model (chapter :numref:`rst_FUN`) to 
calculate the carbon cost and nitrogen acquired through symbotic 
nitrogen fixation. This nitrogen is immediately available to plants.

:ref:`Cleveland et al. (1999) <Clevelandetal1999>` suggested 
an empirical relationships that predicts BNF as a function of 
either evapotranspiration rate or net primary productivity for 
natural vegetation. CLM5.0 adopts the evapotranspiration approach
to calculate asymbiotic, or free-living, N fixation. This function
has been modified from the :ref:`Cleveland et al. (1999) 
<Clevelandetal1999>` estimates to provide lower estimate of 
free-living nitrogen fixation in CLM5.0 
(:math:`{CF}_{ann\_ET}`, mm yr\ :sup:`-1`).
This moves away from the NPP approach used in CLM4.0 and 4.5 and 
avoids unrealistically increasing freeliving rates of N fixation
under global change scenarios (:ref:`Wieder et al. 2015 
<Wiederetal2015>` The expression used is:

.. math::
   :label: 22.1) 

   NF_{nfix,sminn} ={0.0006\left(0.0117+CF_{ann\_ ET}\right)\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {0.0006\left(0.0117+ CF_{ann\_ ET}\right) \left(86400\cdot 365\right)}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \left(86400\cdot 365\right)}

Where :math:`{NF}_{nfix,sminn}` (gN m\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1`) is the rate of free-living nitrogen fixation in :numref:`Figure Biological nitrogen fixation`.


.. _Figure Biological nitrogen fixation:

 Free-living nitrogen fixation as a function of annual evapotranspiration. Results here show annual N inputs from free-living N fixations, but the model actually calculates inputs on a per second basis.

As with Atmospheric N deposition, free-living N inputs are added directly to the
NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` pool.

Nitrification and Denitrification Losses of Nitrogen
---------------------------------------------------------

Nitrification is an autotrophic process that converts less mobile ammonium 
ions into nitrate, that can more easily be lost from soil systems by leaching 
or denitrification.  The process catalyzed by ammonia oxidizing archaea and 
bacteria that convert ammonium (NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+`) into nitrite, which 
is subsequently oxidized into nitrate (NO\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-`). Conditions 
favoring nitrification include high NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` concentrations, 
well aerated soils, a neutral pH and warmer temperatures.

Under aerobic conditions in the soil oxygen is the preferred electron
acceptor supporting the metabolism of heterotrophs, but anaerobic
conditions favor the activity of soil heterotrophs which use nitrate as
an electron acceptor (e.g. *Pseudomonas* and *Clostridium*) supporting
respiration. This process, known as denitrification, results in the
transformation of nitrate to gaseous N\ :sub:`2`, with smaller
associated production of NO\ :sub:`x` and N\ :sub:`2`\ O. It
is typically assumed that nitrogen fixation and denitrification 
were approximately balanced in the preindustrial biosphere (
:ref:`Galloway et al. 2004 <Gallowayetal2004>`). It is likely 
that denitrification can occur within anaerobic
microsites within an otherwise aerobic soil environment, leading to
large global denitrification fluxes even when fluxes per unit area are
rather low (:ref:`Galloway et al. 2004 <Gallowayetal2004>`).

CLM includes a detailed representation of nitrification and
denitrification based on the Century N model (:ref:`Parton 
et al. 1996 <Partonetal1996>`, :ref:`2001 <Partonetal2001>`;
:ref:`del Grosso et al. 2000 <delGrossoetal2000>`). In this 
approach, nitrification of NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` to NO\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-`
is a function of temperature, moisture, and pH:

.. math::
   :label: 22.2) 

   f_{nitr,p} =\left[NH_{4} \right]k_{nitr} f\left(T\right)f\left(H_{2} O\right)f\left(pH\right)

where :math:`{f}_{nitr,p}` is the potential nitrification rate
(prior to competition for NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` by plant
uptake and N immobilization), :math:`{k}_{nitr}` is the maximum
nitrification rate (10 % day\ :math:`\mathrm{-}`\ 1, 
(:ref:`Parton et al. 2001 <Partonetal2001>`), and *f(T)* and 
*f(H\)*\ :sub:`2`\ O) are rate modifiers for temperature and 
moisture content. CLM uses the same rate modifiers as
are used in the decomposition routine. *f(pH)* is a rate 
modifier for pH; however, because CLM does not calculate pH,
instead a fixed pH value of 6.5 is used in the pH function of 
:ref:`Parton et al. (1996) <Partonetal1996>`.

The potential denitrification rate is co-limited by
NO\ :sup:`-3` concentration and C consumption rates, and occurs only in the anoxic fraction of soils:

.. math::
   :label: 22.3) 

   f_{denitr,p} =\min \left(f(decomp),f\left(\left[NO_{3} ^{-} \right]\right)\right)frac_{anox}

where :math:`{f}_{denitr,p}` is the potential denitrification rate
and *f(decomp)* and *f([NO*\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-` *])*
are the carbon- and nitrate- limited denitrification rate functions,
respectively, (:ref:`del Grosso et al. 2000 <delGrossoetal2000>`).
Because the modified CLM includes explicit treatment of soil 
biogeochemical vertical profiles, including diffusion of the trace 
gases O\ :sub:`2` and CH\ :sub:`4` (:ref:`Riley et al. 2011a 
<Rileyetal2011a>`), the calculation of anoxic fraction  :math:`{frac}_{anox}` 
uses this information following the anoxic microsite formulation 
of :ref:`Arah and Vinten (1995) <ArahVinten1995>`.

.. math::
   :label: 22.4) 

   frac_{anox} =\exp \left(-aR_{\psi }^{-\alpha } V^{-\beta } C^{\gamma } \left[\theta +\chi \varepsilon \right]^{\delta } \right)

where *a*, :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta`, :math:`\gamma`, and :math:`\delta` are constants (equal to
1.5x10\ :sup:`-10`, 1.26, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.85, respectively), :math:`{R}_{\psi}` is the
radius of a typical pore space at moisture content :math:`\psi`, *V*
is the O\ :sub:`2` consumption rate, *C* is the O\ :sub:`2`
concentration, :math:`\theta` is the water-filled pore space,
:math:`\chi` is the ratio of diffusivity of oxygen in water to that in
air, and :math:`\epsilon` is the air-filled pore space (:ref:`Arah and 
Vinten (1995) <ArahVinten1995>`). These parameters are all calculated 
separately at each
layer to define a profile of anoxic porespace fraction in the soil.

The nitrification/denitrification models used here also predict fluxes
of N\ :sub:`2`\ O via a “hole-in-the-pipe” approach (:ref:`Firestone and
Davidson, 1989 <FirestoneDavidson1989>`). A constant fraction 
(6 \* 10\ :math:`{}^{-4}`, :ref:`Li et al. 2000 <Lietal2000>`) of the 
nitrification flux is assumed to be N\ :sub:`2`\ O, while the fraction 
of denitrification going to N\ :sub:`2`\ O, \ :math:`{P}_{N2:N2O}`, is variable, following
the Century (:ref:`del Grosso et al. 2000 <delGrossoetal2000>`) approach:

.. math::
   :label: 22.5) 

   P_{N_{2} :N_{2} O} =\max \left(0.16k_{1} ,k_{1} \exp \left(-0.8P_{NO_{3} :CO_{2} } \right)\right)f_{WFPS}

where :math:`{P}_{NO3:CO2}` is the ratio of CO\ :sub:`2`
production in a given soil layer to the
NO\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-`` concentration, :math:`{k}_{1}` is
a function of :math:`{d}_{g}`, the gas diffusivity through the soil
matrix:

.. math::
   :label: 22.6) 

   k_{1} =\max \left(1.7,38.4-350*d_{g} \right)

and :math:`{f}_{WFPS}` is a function of the water filled pore space *WFPS:*

.. math::
   :label: 22.16) 

   f_{WFPS} =\max \left(0.1,0.015\times WFPS-0.32\right)

Leaching Losses of Nitrogen
--------------------------------

Soil mineral nitrogen remaining after plant uptake, immobilization, and
denitrification is subject to loss as a dissolved component of
hydrologic outflow from the soil column (leaching). This leaching loss
(:math:`{NF}_{leached}`, gN m\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1`)
depends on the concentration of dissolved mineral (inorganic) nitrogen
in soil water solution (*DIN*, gN kgH\ :sub:`2`\ O), and the rate
of hydrologic discharge from the soil column to streamflow
(:math:`{Q}_{dis}`, kgH\ :sub:`2`\ O m\ :sup:`-2`
s\ :sup:`-1`, section :numref:`Lateral Sub-surface Runoff`), as

.. math::
   :label: 22.17) 

   NF_{leached} =DIN\cdot Q_{dis} .

*DIN* is calculated assuming that a constant fraction (*sf*, proportion)
of the remaining soil mineral N pool is in soluble form, and that this
entire fraction is dissolved in the total soil water.  For the Century-
based formulation in CLM5.0, the leaching acts only on the
NO\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-`` pool (which is assumed to be 100%
soluble), while the NH\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`+` pool is assumed
to be 100% adsorbed onto mineral surfaces and unaffected by leaching.
*DIN* is then given as

.. math::
   :label: 22.18) 

   DIN=\frac{NS_{sminn} sf}{WS_{tot\_ soil} }

where :math:`{WS}_{tot\_soil}` (kgH:sub:`2`\ O m\ :sup:`-2`) is the total mass of soil water content integrated
over the column. The total mineral nitrogen leaching flux is limited on
each time step to not exceed the soluble fraction of :math:`{NS}_{sminn}`

.. math::
   :label: 22.19) 

   NF_{leached} =\min \left(NF_{leached} ,\frac{NS_{sminn} sf}{\Delta t} \right).

Losses of Nitrogen Due to Fire
-----------------------------------

The final pathway for nitrogen loss is through combustion, also known as
pyrodenitrification. Detailed equations are provided, together with the
effects of fire on the carbon budget, in Chapter :numref:`rst_Fire`). It is assumed in
CLM-CN that losses of N due to fire are restricted to vegetation and
litter pools (including coarse woody debris). Loss rates of N are
determined by the fraction of biomass lost to combustion, assuming that
most of the nitrogen in the burned biomass is lost to the atmosphere
(:ref:`Schlesinger, 1997 <Schlesinger1997>`; :ref:`Smith et al. 2005 
<Smithetal2005>`). It is assumed that soil organic
matter pools of carbon and nitrogen are not directly affected by fire
(:ref:`Neff et al. 2005 <Neffetal2005>`).
