 Using CTSM with WRF
=====================

This section includes instructions on how to use WRF with CTSM using LILAC.
The procedure for building and running the CTSM library and its dependencies
repeats some information from earlier sections but with minimal explanation.

.. important::

  This section assumes use of a machine that has been ported to CIME.
  In this example we assume NCARâ€™s cheyenne computer in particular.


Clone WRF and CTSM Repositories
-------------------------------

Clone the WRF CTSM feature branch::

    git clone https://github.com/billsacks/WRF.git
    cd WRF
    git checkout lilac_dev

.. todo::

    update the git address to WRF feature branch...

Clone the CTSM repository::

    git clone https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM.git
    cd CTSM
    git checkout lilac_cap
    ./manage_externals/checkout_externals

.. todo::

    Remove "git checkout lilac_cap" from the above when ready


Build CTSM and its dependencies
-------------------------------

Build CTSM and its dependencies based on the instructions from previous sections ::

    ./lilac/build_ctsm /PATH/TO/CTSM/BUILD --machine MACHINE --compiler COMPILER

For example on `Cheyenne:` for `Intel` compiler::

    ./lilac/build_ctsm /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir --compiler intel --machine cheyenne


.. note::

    Run ./lilac/build_ctsm -h to see all options available,
    for example if you would like to run with threading support you can use `--build-with-openmp`

.. warning::

    The directory you provided for the build script (``/PATH/TO/CTSM/BUILD``) must *not* exist.
    Alternatively, you can use ``--rebuild`` option.

Building WRF with CTSM
----------------------

First, load the same modules and set the same environments as used for CTSM build by
sourcing ctsm_build_environment.sh for Bash::

    source /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/ctsm_build_environment.sh

or sourcing ctsm_build_environment.csh for Cshell:

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    source /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/ctsm_build_environment.csh

Set makefile variables from CTSM needed for the WRF build by setting the following environment.
For example for Bash::

    export WRF_CTSM_MKFILE=/glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/bld/ctsm.mk

or for Cshell:

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    setenv WRF_CTSM_MKFILE /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/bld/ctsm.mk


There are also few other environmental setting that should be set for building WRF.
Some of these are not required, but might help if you face any compilation errors.
For more information check WRF Users' Guide.


Explicitly define which model core to build by (Bash)::

    export WRF_EM_CORE=1

or (Cshell):	

.. code-block:: Tcsh	

    setenv WRF_EM_CORE 1


Explicilty turn off data assimilation by::

    export WRF_DA_CORE=0

or (Cshell):	

.. code-block:: Tcsh	

    setenv WRF_DA_CORE 0

Now configure and build WRF for your machine and intended compiler::

    ./clean -a
    ./configure


At the prompt choose one of the options, based on the compiler used
for building CTSM. Then you should choose if you'd like to build serially or
in parallel.

.. tip::

    dmpar or distributed memory parallelization is the most highly tested and
    recommended for compiling WRF.

The next prompt requests an option for nesting. Currently nesting is not
available for WRF-CTSM so enter 1.


Now compile em_real and save the log::

    ./compile em_real >& compile.log


Check the bottom of your log file for a successful compilation message
or search the file for the string "Error" with a capital E.

.. note::

    The ./compile step may take more than 30 minutes to complete.
    While you wait, follow the instructions in Section 3.2.2 (next)

.. tip::

    Optional: One may use ``tmux`` or ``nohup`` for configuring and compiling.
    Try ``man nohup`` for more information.

.. seealso::

    For further detail on preparing the CTSM, including how to
    recompile when making code changes to the CTSM, read `Section 3.2.
    <https:../obtaining-building-and-running/index.html>`__

Compile WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)
--------------------------------------

The WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) is a set of programs to prepare
inputs to the real program executable (real.exe) for WRF real-data simulations.
If you wish to complete the offered example with preexisting inputs, then
skip to the next section, which is titled "Run WRF."

.. warning::

    Building WPS requires that WRF be already built successfully.


Get WPS from this website::

    https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/wrf-regist_or_download.php

New users must complete a registration form in this step.

Then compile WPS similar to the way WRF was built. In summary::

    cd WPS
    ./configure

At the prompt choose your intended compiler and parallelization method,
similar to the steps in your WRF build.

Then, compile WPS::

    ./compile >& compile.log

.. note::

    If wps builds succesfully you should see geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe, and metgrid.exe.
    Alternatively, you can check the log for successful build messages.


Run WPS Programs
----------------

Edit ``namelist.wps`` for your domain of interest, which should be the same
domain as used in your WRF namelist.

First, use geogrid.exe to define the domain and interpolate static geographical data
to the grids::

    ./geogrid.exe >& log.geogrid

If the geogrid step finishes successfully, you should see the following message in the log file::

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !  Successful completion of geogrid.  !
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Next, run ungrib to get gribbed data into usable format to be ingested by WRF.

To run ungrib.exe, first link the GRIB data files that are going to be used::

    ./link_grib.csh $your_GRIB_data_path

Based on your GRIB data type, link or copy the appropriate VTable to your WPS directory.
WRF has some prepared VTable under ``/ungrib/Variable_tables/`` folder.

Extract meteorological fields from GRIB-formatted files::

    ./ungrib.exe >& log.ungrib

Check ungrib log for the following message showing successful completion of ungrib step::

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !  Successful completion of ungrib.   !
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


At this point, you should see ungrib output (intermediate files) in your WPS directory.

Horizontally interpolate the meteorological fields extracted by ungrib to
the model grids defined in geogrid::

    ./metgrid.exe >& log.metgrid


Check the metgrid log for the following message showing successful completion of
metgrid step::

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !  Successful completion of metgrid.  !
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




Run real.exe
------------

Run ``real.exe`` to generate initial and boundary conditions.

Follow WRF instructions for creating initial and boundary conditions. 
In summary, complete the following steps:

Move or link WPS output files (``met_em.d01*`` files) to your WRF test directory. 

Edit namelist.input for your WRF domain and desirable configurations.
This should be the same domain as WPS namelist.


.. todo::

    update the option number of wrf namelist.


To run WRF-CTSM, in your namelist change land-surface option to 51::

    sf_surface_physics = 51


.. todo::

    add the link and adding some note that nested run is not possible....

Run real.exe (if compiled parallel submit a batch job) to generate
``wrfinput`` and ``wrfbdy`` files.


Check the last line of the real log file for the following message::

    SUCCESS COMPLETE REAL_EM INIT

Set CTSM runtime options
------------------------

Now follow the instructions in this Section::

 https:../obtaining-building-and-running/setting-ctsm-runtime-options.html

In step 3 of that Section we used for this example::

 lnd_domain_file = /glade/work/slevis/barlage_wrf_ctsm/conus/gen_domain_files/domain.lnd.wrf2ctsm_lnd_wrf2ctsm_ocn.191211.nc
 fsurdat = /glade/work/slevis/git_wrf/ctsm_surf/surfdata_conus_hist_16pfts_Irrig_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191212.nc
 finidat = /glade/work/slevis/git_wrf/ctsm_init/finidat_interp_dest_wrfinit_snow_ERAI_12month.nc

In step 4 of that Section we used for this example::

 atm_mesh_filename = '/glade/work/slevis/barlage_wrf_ctsm/conus/mesh/wrf2ctsm_land_conus_ESMFMesh_c20191216.nc'
 lnd_mesh_filename = '/glade/work/slevis/barlage_wrf_ctsm/conus/mesh/wrf2ctsm_land_conus_ESMFMesh_c20191216.nc' 

In step 6 of that Section you will copy some files to your WRF/run
directory. Then you will be ready to continue.

.. note::

 If you wish to merge your WRF initial conditions from a wrfinput file
 into the existing CTSM initial condition file, complete the following step.

Type::

 module load ncl
 ncl transfer_wrfinput_to_ctsm_with_snow.ncl 'finidat="the_existing_finidat_file.nc"' 'wrfinput="your_wrfinput_file"' 'merged="the_merged_finidat_file.nc"'

.. todo::

 Make the above ncl script available.



Run wrf.exe
-----------

If real.exe completed successfully, we should have ``wrfinput`` and ``wrfbdy`` files
in our directory. 

If you plan to use this example's preexisting files, copy
the following files to your WRF/run directory::

 /glade/work/slevis/git_wrf/WRF/test/em_real/namelist.input.ctsm.2013.d01.12month
 /glade/work/slevis/git_wrf/WRF/test/em_real/wrfinput_d01.ERAI.12month
 /glade/work/slevis/git_wrf/WRF/test/em_real/wrfbdy_d01.ERAI.12month

Now run WRF-CTSM. On Cheyenne this means submitting a batch job to PBS (Pro workload management system).
For detailed instructions on running a batch job on Cheyenne, please check:
https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne/running-jobs/submitting-jobs-pbs

A simple PBS script to run WRF-CTSM on Cheyenne looks like this:

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    #!/bin/tcsh
    #PBS -N your_job_name
    #PBS -A your_project_code
    #PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
    #PBS -q queue_name
    #PBS -j oe
    #PBS -k eod
    #PBS -m abe
    #PBS -M your_email_address
    #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36

    ### Set TMPDIR as recommended
    setenv TMPDIR /glade/scratch/$USER/temp
    mkdir -p $TMPDIR
    source /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/ctsm_build_environment.csh

    ### Run the executable
    mpiexec_mpt ./wrf.exe

If you named this script run_wrf_ctsm.csh, submit the job like this::

    qsub run_wrf_ctsm.csh
