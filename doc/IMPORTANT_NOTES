I.) For clm4_0:

Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:
(options to CLM_CONFIG_OPTS)

   SNICAR_FRC 	(-snicar_frc)
       This mode is tested and functional, but is NOT constantly scientifcally validated, and should be 
       considered experimental.

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

  glc_dyntopo            Change topographic height over glacier MEC (Not functional)
  suplnitro='ALL'        (suplnitro='ALL' with -bgc cn)
                         The suplemental Nitrogen mode of the CN model is known 
                         to be too productive.
  urban_traffic:         Not currently functional

II.) For clm4_5/clm5_0:

Namelist items that are not regularly tested or used. Some aren't even implemented.
