One-line Summary: Avoid glacier dynamic landunit adjustments in first time step

Purpose of changes
------------------

Always avoid generating dynamic landunit adjustments for glacier area
changes in the first timestep of a startup or hybrid run - not just for
cold start or interpolated start. See the detailed discussion in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/340 for rationale.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Fixes #340 (Avoid generating dynamic landunit adjustment fluxes for
  glacier changes in the first timestep)

    cheyenne - not run

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    cheyenne - not run

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    cheyenne_intel ---- ok
    cheyenne_gnu ------ pass
    hobart_nag -------- pass
    hobart_pgi -------- pass
    hobart_intel ------ pass

    ok means tests pass; baseline failures as expected in these two
    tests that do not use init_interp:

    FAIL SMS_Lm13.f19_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput BASELINE ctsm1.0.dev006

    (The glacier area on the finidat file used in these tests -
    clmi.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.2011-01-01.1.9x2.5_gx1v7_gl4_simyr2000_c180715.nc
    - seems to have come from an finidat_interp_dest file, and thus does
    not match the glacier area from CISM.)

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: ctsm1.0.dev006


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Startup / Hybrid runs that include CISM
     (even NOEVOLVE) and do not use init_interp, due to:
     - different PE layout in new case vs. the one that generated the
       finidat (roundoff-level diffs)
     - different glacier area on finidat file vs. what's in CISM
       (greater than roundoff-level diffs)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Roundoff-level for different PE layout, larger than roundoff but
      should be same climate when there is different glacier area on the
      finidat file vs. what's in CISM

      The differences arise from dynamic landunit adjustments of the
      below-ground C and N states in the old code, as CTSM adjusts its
      areas to match CISM's. In the new code, there are no C and N
      adjustments in the first time step from this adjustment.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Fix NFIX flux variables so special land-units are zeroed out, tools update, add some *_MAX fields on mksurfdata_map for transient cases

Purpose of changes
------------------

Nitrogen Fixation flux arrays were being set to missing value over non-vegetated landunits. This sets them to zero everywhere
and averages in the zero's at the gridcell level for history output. It also reads in restarts with missing values and converts
them to zero's.

There are also some tools updates, getting the tools working on the new upgraded hobart.cgd.ucar.edu.

And mksurfdata_map is updated to add some *_MAX files on the landuse.timeseries files that will allow us to conserve memory
for transient cases.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #435, #436, #433 (for tools)
    #435 -- intel build for tools
    #426 -- Nitrogen Fixation flux variables
    #433 -- hobart broken, got it working for tools
