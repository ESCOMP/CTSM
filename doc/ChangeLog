One-line Summary: Use conda environment rather than ncar_pylib with the fsurdat_modifier system test

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 Reason: ncar_pylib is going away soon.

 The fsurdat_modifier system test that we're discussing in this tag and
 corresponding pull request (PR #1798)
 FSURDATMODIFYCTSM_D_Mmpi-serial_Ld1.5x5_amazon.I2000Clm50SpRs.cheyenne_intel
 stopped working when I updated the PR to dev117.
 The test worked in the PR when I was still in dev115.
 The test worked in vanilla dev117.
 I fixed the failure by removing a restriction added in dev116 and the
 corresponding override --allow_ideal_and_include_non_veg.

 I am removing another restriction added in dev116 and the corresponding
 override --allow_dom_pft_and_idealized. This one didn't cause a test to fail
 but unnecessarily restricted usage of the fsurdat_modifier tool.

One-line Summary: Updates to facilitate running FATES at NEON sites

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Small updates to facilitate creation, modification, and 
use of FATES-usable (i.e. 16-PFT) NEON surface data files and 
user-mods for FATES NEON cases.

Updated neon_surf_wrapper.py and modify_singlept_site_neon.py to include a 
--16pft argument that will create and/or modify the 16-PFT versions of the 
surface datasets, as well as a --mixed flag to the neon_surf_wrapper.py 
which tells subset_data to not overwrite the surfae dataset to be just 100% 
one PFT. 

Also corrects lat-lon being used for ONAQ NEON site and updates the surface
datasets for all NEON sites.

Also adds a check to ensure that fire emission (-fire_emis) is not on if FATES
is being run.

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include issue #): 
#1948 - FATES and 78PFT surface datasets
FATES#983 - PRT2 test failing on izumi


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
updated surface datasets for all NEON sites for big-leaf (78-PFT) and FATES (16-PFT)


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
Files changed in cime_config/usermods_dirs/NEON for big-leaf CLM must also
be changed in similar files in cime_config/usermods_dirs/NEON/FATES, as these are
currently duplicated. This duplication should be fixed at a later date.

Changes to tests or testing:
Added a test in bld/unit_testers/build-namelist_test.pl to check that FATES and 
fire emission cannot be on at the same time.

One-line Summary: Small answer changes with bug fixes, zetamaxstable=2 for BHS, new single point fsurdat files

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Change zetamaxstable to 2 when biomass-heat-storage is on. This changes simulation answers once they
run long enough to exceed that threshold.

Also fix an issue with maintence respiration (MR) for BGC simulations. This changes answers for most BGC cases once
they run long enough. Live course MR wasn't included.

Make the default for MOSART to send negative flow to river outlets. Also fix an issue with this mode.

Bring in new surface datasets for the single point sites. We now make these sites using subset_data rather
than mksurfdata.

Some new capability to the subset_data and modify_fsurdat tools.

subset_data add options:
--out-surface -- To name the surface dataset on the command line rather than based on the current date
--cfg-file ----- Enter the default configure file to use rather than assume a fixed one

modify_fsurdat add options:
--fsurdat_in -- to input on command line rather than config file
--fsurdat_out -- to input on command line rather than config file
--allow_ideal_and_include_non_veg -- to allow idealized and include_non_veg at the same time
--allow_dom_pft_and_idealized -- to allow dom_pft and idealized at the same time
--overwrite -- allow output file to be overwritten
config file options:
process_subgrid_section -- Read in an optional section to set the PCT_* fractions
process_var_list_section - Read in an optional section to set any variable on the file

Add --silent option to python tools.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): tools
   Just to the subset_data and fsurdat_modifier tools as outlined above

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   zetamaxstable now 2.0 is use_biomass_heat_storage is on

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): Single point fsurdat
   1x1_brazil, 1x1_numaIA, 1x1_smallvilleIA, 1x1_vancouverCAN, 1x1_mexicocityMEX, 1x1_urbanc_alpha
   surface datasets and 1x1_brazil landuse.timeseries

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   tools test now just activates the ctsm_py conda environment rather than creating it
   There are seperate configure files for each urban surface dataset for modify_fsurdat
   There is a 1850 configure file for subset_data

Changes to tests or testing:
   fsurdatmodifyctsm.py script adjusted to compensate for changes
   python directory changes include unit and system tests to support updates
   Single point mksurdata_map tests were removed

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: clm5_1, supported single point resolutions
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: adjusted climate
       clm5_1 changes because zetmaxstable set to 2.0. If a simulation runs long enough
       this max will be hit and it will change answers once it does. But if stability
       doesn't hit the max answers can be identical.
       clm5_0 and clm4_5 also change if biomass heat storage is turned on
       single point resolutions (i.e. 1x1_smallvilleIA, 1x1_brazil, 1x1_mexicocityMEX) have differences
       maintenence respiration 

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: API compatability with FATES V2 nutrient dynamics

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This set of changes allows CTSM to continue API compatability with changes to the FATES API. FATES has updated its nutrient dynamics routine, and required a modification to the test environment, some minor updates to variable dimensions in the history, and a call to a new FATES history routine.  Implicitly, the updating of the FATES tag introduces new content in the FATES model since the last API update (mostly bug fixes).


Significant changes to scientifically-supported configurations
--------------------------------------------------------------


The changes here will only affect FATES simulations. Any FATES simulation will be affected. Carbon-only FATES simulations will not have qualitatively different results since the last API update (but will have bit-for-bit differences). Nutrient enabled FATES simulations (not fully coupled to CLM, only via prognosed plant N,P boundaries), and FATES-Hydro simulations (bug fix) will be different.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

See the descriptions in FATES tags between sci.1.57.4_api.24.0.0 to sci.1.60.0_api.25.0.0 for details on FATES changes in this tag.

CTSM issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): None

Externals issues fixed (include issue #): None

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include issue #): None

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include issue #): None


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

This set of changes comes with an updated FATES parameter file. This includes format changes only. No changes to variable values were introduced. Format changes are relegated to new parameters and/or name changes only.  These changes are encapsulated in: fates/parameter_files/archive/apichange_24.2to25.xml


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Nothing of note regarding changes for developers.

Changes to tests or testing:  New history variables were added to the FATES PRT2 user_nl_clm.

One-line Summary: Some NEON updates fixing AG sites, update MOSART, small fixes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Minor changes to python scripts and usermod_dirs for NEON cases. Also update the lightning mesh file so that it goes with the
smaller lightning file. Have NEON use new use-cases for 2018 and 2018-PD conditions for CLM. Have NEON
Agricultural sites run with prognostic crop. Simple fix for warning about NaN's in import/export data from/to coupler.

Get NEON tests working on izumi, add --inputdata-dir to subset_data and modify_singlept_site_neon.py so they aren't tied
to only running on cheyenne.

Also update MOSART with fixed for direct_to_outlet option.

Add error checking in ParitionWoodFluxes.  Fix value of albgrd_col in SurfaceAlbefdoType.F90. 
Previously, the wrong value (albgri_col) was being set in InitHistory.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
   NEON users: use neon_gcs_upload now. Filenames for NEON surface
     datasets are changed. Start and end of simulations is different
     for some sites, and managed by the user-mod-directories. The NEON
     user-mod assumes transient cases will run with a transient compset
     and the settings are slightly different for transient vs control
     including pointing to 2018_control or 2018-PD_transient use-cases.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   Add notes to python tools to run using conda environment setup in py_env_create

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   New use cases: 2018_control and 2018-PD_transient

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
   New updated NEON surface datasets

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  Remove toolchain python scripts as this work was moved over to the ctsm5.2 development

Changes to tests or testing:

One-line Summary: Rework fates test definitions and add new fates tests

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag includes a number of updates to the fates test definitions and test list to gain more coverage:

(1) Reorder and update the fates test definitions so that fates satellite phenology mode
can be configured for cases using a compset.

(2) Add a long-term exact restart test to catch issues that may arise due to updates to
fates procedure calls during end of year simulation dates.  

(3) Add a no-competition + fixed biogeography, non-satellite phenology test definition to provide
additional mode combination configuration.

(4) Update the fates externals tag to incorporate a fix a vegetation temperature exact restart 
issue discovered while implementing (1) above.

(5) Truncate all testmods starting with "Fates" to mitigate running over the limits on the length 
of testnames, typically when specifying custom `test_id` using `run_sys_test`.

(6) Updates the expected failures list.

One-line Summary: Fixes for NEON cases

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Two sets of fixes for NEON cases:

(1) Fixes for leap year handling when there are discrepancies between
the model and the DATM forcing data in terms of whether the current year
is a leap year. This involved updates to the share and cdeps externals
from Jim Edwards.

(2) Other fixes for NEON cases from Will Wieder, as documented in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1860

One-line Summary: Introduction of modify_meshes tool for use in I-cases and F-cases

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 Merging the modify_meshes tool to main. This tool is a follow-up to the
 modify_fsurdat tool for I- and F-cases where users are adding land to
 areas that by default were expected as ocean. In such cases, fsurdat
 modifications will take effect only if users also modify the mask_mesh
 file which ultimately determines the landmask used by the CTSM.
 Details in the tool's README.

 Adding test_sys_mesh_modifier.py to python system tests.

 Combining /modify_fsurdat and /modify_mesh_mask directories into one
 directory: /modify_input_files

One-line Summary: If not MIMICS, do not output certain MIMICS history fields

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 Surrounded the "MIC" variables with mimics if-statements to prevent
 from sending to history when not mimics. The MICC_HR fields are already
 inactive, so nothing will appear different in history for these. The
 TOTMIC* fields are active, so they will stop appearing in history when
 not mimics.

 In SoilBiogeochemCarbonFluxType.F90 T_SCALAR is Century-specific, so
 I put a corresponding if-statement around that one.

 We could stop sending to history a few more fields when mimics is off,
 but they would require if-statements while looping through
 ndecomp_cascade_transitions or ndecomp_pools. All such fields are
 already "inactive" in SoilBiogeochemCarbonFluxType.F90.

 The test-suite with all those fields changed to "active" PASSed.
 So not adding if statements for those.

 Other checks:
 - I looked at MICC_HR in a CENTURY simulation and in a MIMICS
 simulation and it looked the same: Zeros over land and 1e36 over ocean.
 - The rest of the "inactive" variables are valid variables for both
 CENTURY and MIMICS.

One-line Summary: Connect ozone from atmosphere

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Allow atmospheric input of ozone partial pressure (monthly, mol/mol) to CTSM and
use this ozone in the OzoneMod module.

Specific notes: Add ozone to atm2lndType and also add as an output history variable (ATM_O3).
Read in O3 in lnd_import_export. Connect to the OzoneMod module:
in CalcOzoneUptakeOnePoint we now use this input ozone, rather than a static parameter.

One-line Summary: Reuse some files generated in initialization when rerunning

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

A new directory is now in your run directory init_generated_files. These
two run time generated files - finidat_interp_dest.nc and the land
fraction file ctsm_landfrac.nc (which is new in this PR) - are put in
that directory when they are created. Then, if they already exist, they
are reused rather than being regenerated. (Technically, it looks for a
status file that flags successful creation of this file.) This applies
when you rerun a startup (non-restart) run a second or subsequent time,
as is common when doing development and testing.

For tests, theinit_generated_files directory is removed before running,
so that rerunning a test will do the same thing the second time.

There are occasional, rare cases when a user would need to manually
remove the init_generated_files directory – e.g., when changing things
about N dominant landunits or PFTs.

Also, output was cleaned up in a few cases so that it did not span
multiple lines.

[ ] ctsm5_0-nwp

[ ] clm4_5


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- If you do a run, then change a runtime parameter that makes the
  previous finidat_interp_dest.nc file incompatible with the new
  configuration (e.g., changing N dominant landunits or PFTs) then
  rerun, you will need to remove the contents of the
  run/init_generated_files subdirectory before rerunning. (You do *not*
  need to remove this directory when changing finidat in user_nl_clm: in
  this specific case, CTSM detects the change and regenerates
  finidat_interp_dest even if one already exists.)

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- Removed finidat_interp_dest from the namelist; it is now hard-coded to
  finidat_interp_dest.nc. (This seemed not to be used much, if ever, and
  supporting this would have complicated the logic in this PR.)

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a new test using a new test type (defined in CIME):
  REUSEINITFILES. This runs two cases and compares them: the first runs
  a case as normal; the second copies in the init_generated_files
  directory from case one and then does a run that uses these saved
  init_generated_files. This ensures that using the init_generated_files
  does not change answers.

Changes answers relative to baseline: NO

    Most FATES tests had baseline comparison failures, just for the

One-line Summary: Update to fates history names and machine configuration

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This PR includes a number of minor fixes and updates associated with FATES.
A duplicate filter for all soils that was introduced during the the initial
implementation of FATES-SP mode is removed.  A small set of FATES history
variable names have been updated necessitating an update to the testmod
user namelists.  The ccs_config and cime externals have been updated to
include the FATES development workstation, lobata.  The cime tag update
is necessary to include a fix enabling support for module initilization
on certain linux distributions (https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/issues/4260).
Finally, a minor fix was included to the initialization of the fates_levcdam
dimension that was introduced with the last fates api update.

One-line Summary: Fix accumulation variables when changing model time step

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Accumulation variables (e.g., 1-day or 10-day averages) were writing and
reading their accumulation period (expressed in time steps) to the
restart file. This caused incorrect behavior when changing the model
time step relative to what was used to create the initial conditions
file (typically a 30-minute time step). So, for example, if you are
using a 15-minute time step with an initial conditions file that
originated from a run with a 30-minute time step (at some point in its
history), then an average that was supposed to be 10-day instead becomes
5-day; an average that was supposed to be 1-day becomes 12-hour, etc.
(The issue is that the number of time steps in the averaging period was
staying fixed rather than the actual amount of time staying fixed.)

For our out-of-the-box initial conditions files, this only impacts runs
that use something other than a 30-minute time step. Typically this
situation arises in configurations with an active atmospheric model that
is running at higher resolution than approximately 1 degree. It appears
that the biggest impacts are on VOC emissions and in BGC runs; we expect
the impact to be small (but still non-zero) in prescribed phenology (SP)
runs that don't use VOC emissions.

This tag fixes this issue by no longer writing or reading accumulation
variables' PERIOD to / from the restart file: this isn't actually needed
on the restart file.

See some discussion in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1789 for
more details, and see
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1802#issuecomment-1182743649 for
some discussion of outstanding weirdness that can result for
accumulation variables when changing the model time step. The summary of
that comment is: There could be some weirdness at the start of a run,
but at least for a startup or hybrid run, that weirdness should work
itself out within about the first averaging period. A branch or restart
run could have some longer-term potential weirdness, so for now I think
we should recommend that people NOT change the time step on a branch or
restart run. With (significant?) additional work, we could probably
avoid this additional weirdness, but my feeling is that it isn't worth
the effort right now. In any case, I feel like my proposed fix will
bring things much closer to being correct than they currently are when
changing the time step.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, but just for configurations
with a time step that is not the standard 30-minute time step.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Simulations with a time step that is not 30-minutes
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):

      Not investigated carefully. There can be substantial differences
      for VOC emissions, and differences may also be significant in BGC
      cases. Differences in SP cases appear to be more limited, since it
      looks like the only differences in SP cases (other than VOC
      emissions) come from differences in the T10 field (10-day average
      temperature), which is used in some photosynthesis calculations.

      For I compset configurations in the test suite, the only
      configurations with time steps differing from 30 minutes are:
        - mexicocity tests (but for the SP cases in the test suite, the
          answer changes are diagnostic-only in a couple of fields, and

One-line Summary: Fix LILAC interface to PIO

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Fixes the LILAC interface to PIO.

This involved splitting shr_pio_mod into two pieces:

(1) Reading configuration files and initializing PIO appropriately

(2) Storing information about PIO (io system descriptors, io types, io
formats) and providing an interface to query this information

Piece (2) lives in the share code and is used regardless of the driver.
Piece (1) is driver-specific, so for now we have three versions of that
piece: one in CMEPS (created by extracting the initialization pieces
from cmeps/cesm/nuopc_cap_share/shr_pio_mod.F90), one in the cpl7 repo
(created by extracting the initialization pieces from
share/src/shr_pio_mod.F90), and one in CTSM's LILAC directory (which is
essentially identical to the one in the cpl7 repo). Piece (2) – the
actual share code piece – is used by components (their use statements
stay exactly as they are now) as well as by piece (1) (which is
responsible for setting the module-level variables in piece (2)). See
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1759#issuecomment-1171779485 for
more context.

Much of the work here was in externals:
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM_share/pull/34,
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CMEPS/pull/306 and
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM_CPL7andDataComps/pull/16. So this PR
updates those externals to versions with those changes. In addition,
changes were needed within LILAC - to implement the LILAC version of
piece (1) described above.

One-line Summary: Fix winter wheat sowing window bugs

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Fixes problems with winter wheat sowing criteria: The "normal" sowing
condition for winter wheat only accounted for whether today is on/after
the first day of the planting window; it did not also require that today
is on/before the last day of the window. Additionally, the "last chance"
condition allowed planting anytime on/after the last day of the window.
See https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1691 for details.

Winter wheat is not present in our standard surface datasets, so this
has no impact on typical simulations.

One-line Summary: Start bringing in matrixcn overall options and sparse matrix multiplier code, misc updates

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

First Commit of CN Matrix Solution:
Start bringing in the use_matrixcn and use_soil_matrixcn control options for the Carbon/Nitrogen BGC model using
the matrix solution methodology developed by Dr. Yiqi Luo and his EcoLab members: Drs. Xingjie Lu,
Yuanyuan Huang and Zhengguang Du, at Northern Arizona University

Work on Anomaly forcing for SSEP scenarios:
Do some work on anomoly forcing for SSP scenarios. Update the script in tools/contrib to work with the latest
data and replicate results of Keith Oleson and Sean Swenson. Add some test cases for it.

Python Environment Management using Conda:
More work on the manage_python_env script to setup the "ctsm_py" conda environment. This now works for UCAR machines
(such as cheyenne and casper) as well as CGD machines (like izumi). This script can also be called for tools, and
the test tools mechanism is now using it rather than ncar_pylib.

./manage_python_env

SCAM Fix:
Add checkimport method for CMEPS so that single-column case can work with SCAM, from Jim Edwards.

Black Formatter for Python Code:
Run "black" python code reformatter on all code under the "python" directory. Add the commits
to .git-blame-ignore-revs so they can be ignored when "git blame" is used, if you add this
to each clone where you want this to apply:

   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

You can do it for your worktrees, but since the file only applies to CTSM for ctsm5.1.dev100 and
forward, you'll need to do it for each CTSM clone seperately. Also there is now a github action
that checks that python code under the "python" subdirectory is black clean. If it's not the action
will fail and send you an email about it.

Make Map Data Fix:
Simple fix from Sam Rabin.

Fix for DISPLA on History Output:
Fix from Keith Oleson to set history output for DISPLA (displa_patch) to zero when vegetation is buried by snow.

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   There is the introduction of lots of if statements for use_matrixcn and use_soil_matrixcn.
   These if statements are added, but they are hardcoded off, so inactive. In some cases the
   if statements could be reduced with some work, but maintaing both versions will be important
   until that does happen. These statements need to be kept in the code, as well as a few places
   where variables that will be needed for the Matrix solution code are added in, even though
   they aren't needed in this version.

   Some development was done on the tools/contrib/ssp_anomaly_forcing_smooth script, but the guts should
   be moved over to the python directory, and the top level script moved outside of the contrib directory.

   Change name of bias-correction test

One-line Summary: Enabling FATES control over the number of patches on the natural land unit

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This set of changes 1) allows FATES to dictate the number of patches on the naturaly vegetated land unit and 2) is compatible with a version of FATES that updates the parameter file format (changes in parameter naming and parameter set).  Efforts were made to adhere to the system of how patches are looped and loop bounds are defined. There is interaction with the reading of the surface file, which previously dictated all patch counts based on the number of PFTs in the file.  FATES-SP and biogeography preserves the ability to use surface file weighting factors associated with PFTs and CFTs to drive area fractions in FATES.  This change is motivated by FATES-side updates to the parameter file, which includes new settings where the user can control the number of primary "fates_maxpatch_primary" and secondary "fates_maxpatch_secondary" patches. Users should also be aware of a new namelist setting "use_fates_tree_damage" which defaults to false (inoperative).

Fixes #1784 "Get dry-deposition working with FATES-SP mode"

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Relevant issue #1785 "Refactor surfrd for FATES"
Relevant issue #1780 "Some collapse options should be disabled with FATES"

In the process of this PR, we learned that FATES is fundamentally incompatible with the dry-deposition code. FATES-SP may be compatibile, but still needs investigation.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): There is a new namelist setting for FATES simulations that turns on the crown damage module: "use_fates_tree_damage". Settings for this module can be found in the FATES parameter file.  This namelist variable is a binary true/false, and it defaults to false.

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): Users should also be aware that FATES has a new parameter file format and API. The default file on the ucar dataserver has been updated.

Substantial timing or memory changes: none that we're aware of, but with more refined control of patch counts and allocation should come improvements in memory usage.


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): None.  Some new code was added to surfrdMod.F90, but this is not redundant. Efforts may be made in the future to have more unification there when we have FATES compatable with crops on the crop land-unit.

Changes to tests or testing:  Tests were added to cover the new crown damage module, and combinations of dry-deposition and megan with FATES-SP.  The build system is also aware that these features will not and should not be used with FATES in a non-SP framework.

One-line Summary: Correct perched water table calculation

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Modifies the calculation of the frost table and perched water table
layers.

This brings in the answer-changing aspects of the Hillslope Hydrology
branch (https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1715).

Specific changes are:

* PerchedWaterTable

1) Frost table depth

a) original frost table determination looped from the top
of the soil column downward to the index of the first layer
whose temperature was <= freezing, and whose neighbor above
had a temperature above freezing.  The frost table depth is
then given by the node of that soil layer, i.e. z(k_frz).

b) in the new method, the same index is found, but the
depth of the frost table is given by the depth of the top
of the frozen layer, i.e. zi(k_frz-1).  Note zi(k_frz) would
be the bottom of layer k_frz.

2) Perched water table depth

a) in the original formulation, a loop from k_frz to layer 1
was used to identify the deepest layer in 1:k_frz whose
volumetric soil moisture was greater than a threshold given
by sat_lev (e.g. sat_lev = 0.9).

b) in the new method, the search is only done if k_frz is
greater than 1.  The rationale is that if k_frz = 1, then
zwt_perched has already been initialized to the frost_table
depth (which is equal to the top of the uppermost soil layer),
and therefore no search is required.

3) Determining perched water table depth within layer
identified by index k_perch in 2)

a) in the original formulation, the perched water table
depth was calculated by linearly interpolating between layers
k_perch and k_perch+1, with no consideration of their relative
values.  In the case where the deeper layer was drier than the
layer above it, this could result in values far outside the
soil layer.

b) in the new formulation, if the deeper layer is drier than the
layer above it (s1 > s2), then the perched water table depth is
simply given by the depth of the upper surface of layer k_perch,
i.e. zi(c,k_perch-1).

* PerchedLateralFlow

1) Removal of icefrac calculation

a) in the original calculation, the frozen layer was included,
so an ice impedance factor was calculated using icefrac.  If
only unfrozen layers are used, no ice impedance factor is needed.

b) in the new formulation, the icefrac variable and loop are
removed.

2) Move loop calculating frost and perched water table depths

a) in the original formulation, the frost and perched water
table depths were calculated in the same loop as the calculation
of the lateral flow from the perched saturated zone.

b) in preparation for the hillslope hydrology branch, this
calculation is moved into its own loop.

3) q_perch calculation

a)in the original formulation, q_perch was calculated by summing
over layers k_perch to k_frost.  However, because k_frost is now
identified as the frozen layer, and its depth the top of the frozen
layer, it should not be included in the calculation; only the
unfrozen layers above it should be included.

b) in the new formulation, the loop is bounded by k_frost-1 instead
of k_frost.

4) Removal of water from perched saturated zone

a) the in the original method, the frozen layer (k_frost)
was included in the loop.  Also, the drainage was defined to be
negative, which was confusing.

b) in the new method, the frozen layer is not included in the
loop; water is only removed from the unfrozen layers above k_frost.
Calculate drainage as positive values, which are then subtracted
from the soil moisture in each layer.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
   Fixes: #1720 -- Get FatesSp to run without soil-BGC
   Fixes: #1726 -- Tutorial tasks
   Fixes: #1729 -- SIGFPE in ch4Mod with DEBUG=TRUE
   Fixes: #1610 -- Replace izumi_pgi tests with cheyenne_nvhpc
   Initial add of FatesSP compset: #1697
   Starts adding a test mod for: #1722 FatesSP with prescribed LAI
   Some part of #1736 threading tests for Fates

   Known bugs introduced in this tag (include issue #):
    #1744 -- DAE tests fail
    #1743 -- NEON test fails on izumi

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
   FatesSp mode MUST be run with soil_decomp_method of None.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   Add new compset: I2000Clm51FatesSpCruRsGs
   Add new long compset trigger for FATES-SP mode: FATES-SP
   And new user-mod directory: fates_sp

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  It's hardcoded in both build-namelist and the FORTRAN code that FatesSp mode must
  be run with soil_decomp_method set to None. Some if statements would allow this to
  change, but not all.

Changes to tests or testing:
   Replace izumi_pgi with cheyenne_nvhpc
   Remove pgi mct test, since DEBUG off nvhpc tests work
   Add a DEBUG on test for FatesSp that currently fails (for fates testlist)
   Have FatesColdDefReducedComplexSatPhen test-mod use the new fates_sp user-mod
   Add FatesSp threaded test (both fates and aux_clm test lists)
   FatesSp tests use new FatesSp compset

One-line Summary: subset_data allows zeroing out nonveg landunits without any dompft selected

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------
Previously subset_data explicitly checked to make sure the user has chosen at
least one of the following options:

dominant pft(s) or
--include-nonveg (overrides default setting non-veg units to 0%)

However, Adrianna pointed out that this limits FATES users who would not
want to set a dominant pft(s) and would also want all 100% vegetated at the
single point. So I removed this capability. This needed recalculating
PCT_CROP and PCT_NATVEG while zero-ing out other land unit types.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
 Previously the user needed to choose at least one of the following options
 for subsetting at single points:
 --dompft
 --include-nonveg
 Now the user is not required to specify either options and can still zero out
 non-veg landunits without any dominant pft given by the user.

One-line Summary: Refactor NutrientCompetition / CNAllocation to provide hooks for AgSys

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Major refactor of NutrientCompetition / CNAllocation to provide hooks
for AgSys crop model: separates the NutrientCompetition modules into
pieces based on (1) consolidating duplicate code between the Clm45 and
FlexibleCN versions, and (2) separating pieces that will vs. won't be
used for crop patches when running with the upcoming AgSys crop model.

I have restored the old CNAllocationMod, with some of the
responsibilities that it used to have. (I'm not sure it's appropriate to
have the calculation of gpp and maint resp in CNAllocationMod, but I
left it there because it has always been combined with the allocation
code, including back when we had a separate CNAllocationMod.)

Changes answers relative to baseline: NO - though potential for answer
changes in unusual cases

   One change in this tag has the potential for answer changes in
   unusual cases, even though no answer changes were observed in
   testing: Previously, only the FlexibleCN code applied some logic that
   changed crop allocation fractions during the grainfill period if
   peaklai had been reached. I have changed this so that this logic is
   applied with or without FlexibleCN (because I have moved this block
   of code to the CNAllocation module, which is shared between the
   FlexibleCN and non-FlexibleCN versions). I thought this would change
   answers, but it appears not to, at least based on the tests in the
   test suite as well as an extra 5-year test I did at f19 resolution
   (ERS_Ly5.f19_g17.IHistClm45BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput).
   It's possible that this changes answers in rare cases or with an
   unusual combination of options that we don't test: specifically, it
   might change answers for the atypical situation where you are running
   with FUN but not FlexibleCN. (In this case, I believe this change is
   the correct thing to do.)

One-line Summary: clm decomp method is now passed to fates to enabled mimics coupling

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This is a small changeset, which only adds the passing of a text based flag to FATES, that defines which soil decomposition method is active. This setting is needed by FATES, so that it can pass specific boundary conditions to CLM (and potentially ELM in the future). This change was necessitated because MIMICS requires a Nitrogen to lignin-carbon ratio in the litter flux, yet other decomposition schemes do not. Moreover, the generation of this boundary condition is not trivial, so it is worth it to avoid its computation if mimics is not on.  This change should have NO impact on any tests.

One-line Summary: For CLM45 apply peaklai to aleaf in grainfill

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag makes the crop allocation code in
NutrientCompetitionCLM45defaultMod consistent with that in
NutrientCompetitionFlexibleCNMod by forcing aleaf to 1e-5 if peaklai has
been reached during the grainfill period (in addition to the similar
existing check that was already in both places during the vegetative
growth period). This reconciliation will be helpful so that I can
extract these into a shared subroutine.

I thought this would potentially change answers for CLM45 cases, but
based on the test suite and from a 5-year run of IHistClm45BgcCrop at
f19_g17 resolution, it seems like this won't change answers in our
typical configurations: From that 5-year f19_g17 run, whenever peaklai
is 1 during the grainfill period, aleaf is already exactly 1e-5. I don't
understand why this is always the case; maybe, in Clm45, if peaklai
isn't reached before grainfill then it is never reached that growing
season? I have come to suspect that the difference between Clm45 and
Clm50 in this respect may actually be due to whether you're running with
FUN, since running with FUN changes some relevant driver sequencing. So
it's possible that this would change answers for the atypical situation
where someone was running with FUN but not FlexibleCN; in this case, I
think this change would be the right thing to do. In addition, from the
test suite, I found this leads to answer changes when using CLM45
together with old hydrology (h2osfcflag = 0 and use_subgrid_fluxes =
.false.).

One-line Summary: Add outputs for annual crop sowing and harvest dates

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Added annual outputs of sowing and harvest dates (`SDATES` and `HDATES`,
respectively). This should simplify the determination of sowing and
harvest date for postprocessing.
- Sowing dates are on new dimension `mxgrowseas` (maximum number of
  growing seasons allowed to begin in a year; currently hard-coded to 1).
- Harvest dates are on new dimension `mxharvests` (maximum number of
  harvests allowed in a year), which is `mxgrowseas`+1. This is needed
  because in year Y you might harvest a field that was planted in year
  Y-1, then plant and harvest again.
- The lengths of these dimensions are public constants of `clm_varpar`.

Additionally, removed `cropplant` as discussed here:
<https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1500#issuecomment-951404634>.

The `mxharvests` concept enables the addition of more such outputs to
further simplify crop postprocessing—for example, yield per growing
season as a direct output rather than needing to cross-reference daily
grain mass against the day of harvest.

These changes involved some rework to the crop phenology code that
changes answers for crop phenology in some circumstances. All answer
changes were determined to be due to issues / oddities in the old code.
See discussion in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1616 for details
(especially see
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1616#issuecomment-1049247565). To
summarize briefly, some issues with the old code were:
- Non-winter-cereal patches that had live crops at the beginning of the
  year did not get planted later that year.
- There was some odd behavior for rice patches at exactly 0 deg latitude
- Crop root depth had unexpected values outside the growing season; now
  root depth is set to 0 outside the growing season

    Changes answers for crop cases that are at least a few months long
    and/or cross the year boundary; also SSP tests with Crop. These
    changes arise due to fixing some issues / oddities that were present
    in the old code.

    Also changes ROOT_DEPTH outside of the crop growing season.

    See description above for details, and also extensive discussion in

One-line Summary: Reduce aux_clm testing cost

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Use small PE counts for aux_clm tests and remove some redundant /
unnecessary tests.

This tag reduces the PE count for aux_clm tests so that all (I think)
tests fit in 4 nodes or less. This should both (1) reduce queue wait
time for tests and (2) reduce aux_clm testing cost (since, for high
resolution tests, most time is spent in initialization, so having more
PEs increases cost significantly without actually making the tests run
much, if any, faster). While doing this, I also noticed some tests that
felt redundant or unnecessary, and I have removed those.

To facilitate these changes, I have introduced new "S" PE layouts for
the f09, f19 and 0.125nldas2 resolutions. These layouts use 4 nodes (but
with DATM on just 1 node, because it is slightly faster to run it on one
node than four nodes). (I considered running DATM on its own node like
we do for production PE layouts, but that turns out to only improve
runtime slightly while increasing cost significantly, so I am having
DATM share one of the nodes used for LND.)

Here is a detailed list of the changes:

    and I completely removed the following tests:

    In general, these removed tests felt redundant with existing tests
    (including some low-resolution tests that I happened to notice as
    feeling redundant as I was reworking the testing).

Changes to ctsm_sci test list:

    See notes above for tests moved from the aux_clm test list to the
    ctsm_sci test list; other than that, I did not make any changes to
    the ctsm_sci test list.

Changes to prealpha test list

    I made the following changes to the prealpha test list to keep it in
    line with the aux_clm test list:

    ```

    In addition, I removed the following from the prebeta test list:

    ERP_Ld5.f19_g17.I2000Clm50SpRtmFl.cheyenne_gnu.clm-default
    SMS_Ld1.f19_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCru.cheyenne_intel.clm-default
    SMS_Lm1.f19_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCropCmip6waccm.cheyenne_intel.clm-basic # The main point of this test is simply to make sure that the CMIP6WACCMDECK modifier works for 2-degree since that resolution turns off Carbon isotopes

    For the removed tests, we already have similar tests to these
    removed tests in the prealpha and/or prebeta test suites. (It is
    unnecessary to have the same tests in both prealpha and prebeta test
    lists, because the prebeta test list is generally just run on tags
    that have already been through prealpha testing.)

Other test categories:

    I did not make any changes to other test categories: fates,
    aux_cime_baselines, clm_pymods or clm_short. The fates test category
    has some high resolution tests that should probably be changed
    similarly to what I did here.

Some notes on the changed tests:

    All of the new (changed) tests pass. Nearly all of them run in less
    than 10 min (and some of them actually run faster than before); the
    one exception is
    `SMS_Lm13_PS.f19_g17.I2000Clm51BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput`,
    which has a 31 min run time; that is as expected. I feel like that's
    acceptable: it's in the neighborhood of some of our other long
    tests, and I feel like it's worth having one more long-running test
    in order to avoid having anything that might sit in the queue too
    long. We could consider putting this test on something like 8 nodes
    instead of 4 if we find that it is consistently the last test to
    finish, but for now I wanted to try for a goal of having all tests
    on 4 nodes or fewer.

    I compared the detailed timing files from the new
    `PFS_Ld10_PS.f19_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel` test with the
    original `PFS_Ld20.f09_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel` test.
    For the most part, the relative timings of different pieces are
    about the same in both - at least for the major culprits, which is
    what I compared. So this is good: I feel like we can use the new
    test to still give indications of when the timing of a particular
    section changes significantly, and be reasonably confident that the
    same result would hold for an f09 test with higher processor count.

    The total testing time from start to finish is:
    - cheyenne_gnu: 1:06
    - cheyenne_intel: 2:10
    - izumi_gnu: 1:09
    - izumi_intel: 1:46
    - izumi_nag: 1:31
    - izumi_pgi: 1:27

    Note that I think the izumi tests would have completed sooner if not
    for the fact that we are limited in how many jobs we can run

    SMS_Lm13_PS.f19_g17.I2000Clm51BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput,

One-line Summary: Updates necessary for NEON v2 files and server updates

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag resolves the issues that are caused by NEON moving their storage from Amazon
S3 to GCS (Google Cloud Storage) and updated listing files, two issues need to be addressed.
To summarize, this tag addresses these issues:

1- run_neon.py is updated to handle the updated listing file and
introduction of the new v2 data.

2- CDEPS, CIME, and run_neon.py codes should be updated to point to the GCS bucket instead of the
neon S3 bucket. Besides updating run_neon.py this tag points to the updated
externals with this updates.

     either model output or namelists, is: create sym links pointing to the last tag's baseline directory,
     named with the upcoming tag; then run the clm_pymods test suite comparing against these baselines but NOT
     doing their own baseline generation. If you are already running the full aux_clm then you do NOT need to

One-line Summary: Expand crop reproductive pools; remove some unused options

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

The main change in this tag is adding placeholder pools (and
corresponding fluxes) that will be needed to couple the AgSys crop
model: Rather than a single grain pool, AgSys has two different grain
pools (meal & oil) as well as two different reproductive structure pools
(pod & floret). This tag adds a dynamically-allocated second dimension to
the relevant variables to accommodate these new pools. The new
CropReprPoolsMod controls the allocation and naming of these pools, and
facilitates looping over the new dimension. Currently parameters in
there are hard-coded for the current crop model, but this will become
more dynamic with the coupling of AgSys.

This tag also removes experimental / untested options in
NutrientCompetitionFlexibleCNMod. Although this is mostly unrelated to
the main change, doing this simplified the changes needed for the main
change.

This tag also resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1666 (Isotopic values of grain_mr not
set correctly when use_grainproduct is false).

Finally, this tag removes or modifies some of the most expensive tests
in the aux_clm test suite to reduce the cost of running the test suite.

One-line Summary: Changes to CropPhenology timing

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Changes to CropPhenology timing to support
https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/1616 and other work being done by
Sam Rabin:

(1) Change CropPhenology to look at the time as of the START of the time
    step. Previously, CropPhenology looked at time as of the END of the
    time step. This was somewhat problematic, particularly because it
    meant that the last time step of the year was considered Jan 1, and
    so crops with a planting window beginning Jan 1 could be planted at
    the end of the previous year rather than the start of the new year.
    This was becoming particularly problematic in the context of Sam
    Rabin's upcoming prescribed sowing date work (see #1623 and #1616
    for some discussion).

(2) Call CropPhenology regardless of doalb (however, still do not call
    CropPhenology on time step 0). (See some discussion in #1626 and
    #1623.)

      Based on an analysis of the code, the differences should be small,
      but I haven't investigated this with simulations. In principle,
      there could be larger answer changes for crops that invoke
      vernalization in cases where doalb isn't true every time step, but
      currently I think we don't simulate any crops that invoke
      vernalization. It's also possible that there are other larger
      changes in cases where doalb isn't true every time step (i.e., F
      and B compsets), though from reading through the code, I don't see
      any potentials for big changes.

One-line Summary: Rework single-point testing

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Two changes to make the single-point tests in our test suite run more
smoothly. The main motivation for this is that single-point tests have
been failing frequently on cheyenne, presumably due to issues with nodes
in the share queue.

(1) Rework the test list to remove redundant single-point tests and move
    many of our single-point tests from cheyenne to izumi. (With (2) in
    place, this isn't really necessary, but given that we're going to be
    using full nodes for single-point tests, it seems better to do this
    on izumi rather than wasting all of these processors on the
    generally more heavily-loaded cheyenne. Also, this helps accomplish
    the goal of providing better balance between our different
    machine-compiler permutations, helping to reduce overall testing
    time.)

(2) Change run_sys_tests so that, for the remaining single-point tests
    on cheyenne, we use the regular queue rather than the share queue.
    This means that single-point tests use a full node, which is
    wasteful but makes the tests more reliable. (You can override this
    behavior with the --queue option to run_sys_tests: To revert to the
    earlier behavior, where the queue is determined automatically for
    each test, add '--queue unspecified' to your run_sys_tests
    invocation. (As before --queue can also be used to specify some
    other queue to use for all tests.))

One-line Summary: Updates to FATES API, including removal of patch dimensions from fates history and using soil instead of ground layers for fates history.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This set of changes cleaned up some aspects of the FATES history diagnostics API. Patches are not used in output diagnostics, so they were removed from the history coupling. Also, FATES only "sees" the soil, not the rock layers, so it is more appropriate to only align FATES below ground history output on the soil layers, and not ground layers.  Also, the corresponding FATES side changes have some history output names changed. This is an API change as well, and is compatable with FATES: https://github.com/NGEET/fates/releases/tag/sci.1.54.0_api.22.0.0

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

	FATES users should now benefit from more interpretable history output from soil dimensioned variables, where they won't have to filter out ground layers which previously contained no-data flags.  Also, note the following FATES history variable name changes:

	FATES_ROOTH2O_ABS_SZPF -> FATES_ABSROOT_H2O_SZPF
	FATES_ROOTH2O_TRANS_SZPF -> FATES_TRANSROOT_H2O_SZPF
	FATES_STEMH2O_SZPF -> FATES_STEM_H2O_SZPF
	FATES_LEAFH2O_SZPF -> FATES_LEAF_H2O_SZPF
	FATES_ROOTH2O_POT_SZPF -> FATES_ABSROOT_H2OPOT_SZPF
	FATES_ROOTH2O_TRANSPOT_SZPF -> FATES_TRANSROOT_H2OPOT_SZPF
	FATES_STEMH2O_POT_SZPF -> FATES_STEM_H2OPOT_SZPF
	FATES_LEAFH2O_POT_SZPF -> FATES_LEAF_H2OPOT_SZPF
	FATES_ROOT_ABSFRAC_SZPF -> FATES_ABSROOT_CONDFRAC_SZPF
	FATES_ROOT_TRANSFRAC_SZPF -> FATES_TRANSROOT_CONDFRAC_SZPF
	FATES_STEMH2O_FRAC_SZPF -> FATES_STEM_CONDFRAC_SZPF
	FATES_LEAFH2O_FRAC_SZPF -> FATES_LEAF_CONDFRAC_SZPF

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): FATES users may have scripts that assume below ground diagnostics are on the ground dimension, and will have to update scripts to use the soil dimension.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): No changes to defaults, but some FATES plant hydraulics history variable names were changed in the corresponding FATES tag.

Changes to tests or testing: An update was made to the fates-hydro tests to use updated history variable names.


Testing summary:
----------------

    d) regular (regular tests on normal machines if CTSM source is modified)

    cheyenne ---- /glade/scratch/rgknox/tests_0220-124230ch  (OK) expected FATES baseline DIFFS
    izumi ------- /scratch/cluster/rgknox/tests_0220-125238iz (OK)

  fates tests: fates test suite was run, (OK)


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: All results are B4B with base (dev076), except for two conditions: 1) FATES output that uses the soil dimension has NLCOMP and DIFFS due to the dimension change, and 2) FATES hydro simulations have different results due to bug fixes

One-line Summary: updating subset_data.py script and move to the Python package.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------
The purpose of this PR was to update and move the subset_data.py and other
relevant python scripts to the CTSM python package so the other python codes
(such as fsurdat_modifier) can re-use/import the capabilities of this script.

This updated code now adds the capability to create user-mods for a generic
singlepoint case.

The subset_data.py (top script called subset_data)extracts surface dataset,
domain file, landuse, and DATM files at a single point or a region from the
available global dataset. Next it modifies the surface dataset based on the
user options (command-line arguments) for example dom-pft or zero-ing non-veg
types, etc.

One-line Summary: Small answer changes: urban ventilation, fire-emission, irrigate off when not crop, fix two SSP ndep files

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

The effects of ventilation (exchange of building air with canopy air) are accounted for in the
energy budget inside the building.  The effects on urban canopy air are not. This remedies that.

This fixes an issue with how coefficients are applied to individual fire components. Allow units
to be in molecules/m2/sec as well as kg/m2/sec.

SSP3-7.0 Nitrogen-deposition file update.  Fix SSP2-4.5 Nitrogen-deposition file.  Turn irrigation
off by default except for future scenarios.

Add new external ccs_config_cesm which has the CESM cime configuration files.

 New option MIMICSWieder2015 for use with namelist variable soil_decomp_method
 decomp_depth_efolding removed as values on param files was already being used

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 CLM parameter files now include new MIMICS-related parameters prefixed with
 mimics_. Existing CENTURYKoven-specific parameters were renamed to include the
 prefix bgc_. Parameters used by both CENTURYKoven2013 and MIMICSWieder2015 have
 neither prefix.

Substantial timing or memory changes:
 Timing comparison between CENTURYKoven (BGC for short) and MIMICSWieder:

But these general fixes end up fixing a few other minor issues with
Gregorian calendar runs as well.

    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):

   The only test with answer changes is
   SMS_C2_D_Lh12.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Sp.cheyenne_intel.clm-pauseResume;
   that test just has answer changes in the time-0 history file because
   of the fix to the AnnualFluxDribbler's flux in the last time step of
   the year (which is the time step used for time 0). There were answer

One-line Summary: Small changes to enable new fates dimension and update fates tag

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag uncomments the fates_levleaf dimension which was added in PR #1540
and rolled into PR #1542, but commented out to avoid junk DIFFs during integration
of PR #1542.  This variable is necessary to accomodate FATES PR #752, which
allows for an exponential spacing to bin widths in the VAI (LAI+SAI) calculations.
This latest fates tag also includes a fix to the fates satellite phenology mode
exact restart issue.

One-line Summary: Implement dynamic (transient) urban capability

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This implements the capability to run transient simulations with changes
in urban density types. However, see Caveats for users section below.
If transient urban is activated (do_transient_urban=.true.) and an
appropriate landuse dataset is provided, the model will read in
yearly PCT_URBAN for three density types from the landuse dataset and
adjust other landunits accordingly.
Water and energy are conserved for these transitions. Urban landunits
do not account for carbon and nitrogen, however, see the dynamic urban
design document (doc/design/dynamic_urban.rst) for a discussion of this.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
Note that this capability is off by default because landuse datasets
with transient urban on them are still being developed.
Note also that if this capability is activated (e.g., for testing) then
run_zero_weight_urban must be set to .true.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
Added do_transient_urban namelist variable

One-line Summary: Adding fsurdat_modifier tool

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 I copied the next four paragraphs from /tools/modify_fsurdat/fsurdat_modifier:
 fsurdat_modifier is a tool that modifies fsurdat files. It reads a surface
 dataset (fsurdat file) and outputs a modified copy of the same file.

 Current applications are limited to the simplest CTSM(SP) mode, so bgc, fire,
 urban, vic, lake, transient, and crop-related variables in the fsurdat file
 remain unchanged.

 It differs from modify_singlept_site_neon.py in that the latter specifically
 modifies soil properties of single-point surface datasets. Some functions
 could/should become shared for use by fsurdat_modifier.

 It also differs from the subset_data tool in that the latter subsets fsurdat
 files to regional or single-point domains. Though subset_data includes some
 "modify" functionality when subsetting to single-point, we intend for similar
 functionality to be more extensive and more object oriented in
 fsurdat_modifier. Again, some functions could/should become shared among
 these tools.

One-line Summary: NEON UI update, externals updates, small miscellanouse fixes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Redo options list to remove positional arguments that were difficult to input correctly.
Transient runs now use run_type startup and get finidat from s3 server unless --run-from-postad option is used (or finidat is not
available). Use mpi instead of mpi-serial, this mod was recommended for container use. Add a new script neon_finidat_upload which
allows authorized users to upload finidat files to the s3 server.

This includes the following changes to the script for updating the surface dataset at neon sites using available neon data (i.e.
modify_singlept_site_neon.py) to address ctsm/issues #1353, #1429, and neon/issue #44:

Update Organic calculation to use the following equation based on discussions in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1375/files#r669590971 :
ORGANIC = estimatedOC * bulkDensity / 0.58

Because estimatedOC is rounded to the nearest integer in neon data, it is sometimes bigger than carbonTot. Therefore, in cases where
estimatedOC > carbonTot, we use carbonTot instead of estimatedOC in the above equation.

Previously, we had missing data on neon files for some neon soil layers (see Modified NEON surface datasets have errors  #1429
(comment)). Therefore, it caused some missing values in the updated dataset. Here, we interpolate to fill in the missing data using
different interpolation techniques. Finally, we chose to use linear interpolation to fill in missing data.

This includes the scripts for modification of the surface dataset for neon sites to address #1429.
Specifically, the following has been addressed in this PR:

Update the calculation of ORGANIC to use the new field (CaCO3) from NEON data.
For this calculation if CaCO3 data is available, we first calculate inorganic carbon by:
inorganic carbon = (caco3 /100.0869)*12.0107
Next, we calculate organic carbon by subtracting inorganic carbon from the total carbon:
[organic carbon = carbon_tot - inorganic carbon]
If the CaCO3 is not available then the code uses carbonTot and estimatedOC by NEON.

Discussed here (Modified NEON surface datasets have errors  #1429 (comment))
For the Ag sites (KONA and STER), it changes the PCT_NATVEG, PCT_CROP, and PCT_NAT_PFT to avoid the error that we previously had in
spin-up: surfrd_veg_all ERROR: sum of wt_nat_patch not 1.00000000000000 at nl= 1 sum is: 0.000000000000000E+000

Discussed here (Modified NEON surface datasets have errors  #1429 (comment))
There was a typo previously in the NEON data for ABBY sites caused by mix of sample measurements. Please note that this was updated
by hand once data was downloaded from NEON site.

With recent versions of CIME, the LILAC build with a user-defined machine was broken for a couple of reasons. This fixes it.

Fix mksurfdata_map for 1x1_brazil. Get tools testing working again. Increase skip_steps by 1, which is needed for a change in CAM
where balance checks need to occur after the radiation update now rather than before. glob changed for bsd_glob in perl MkDepends
for mksurfdata_map.

One-line Summary: API change with FATES to enable running means inside fates, includes passing in of model timestep

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This set of changes synchronizes CTSM with API 20 of FATES.  API 20 of FATES requires a modification to timing boundary conditions so that FATES can maintain its own internal running means.  FATES also no-longer asks CTSM for the 24hour vegetation temperature, since this is a patch(pft) level variable, and FATES has more suitable averaging mechanisms.  These changes are synchronized with FATES Pull Request: https://github.com/NGEET/fates/pull/724, which subsequently created tag: https://github.com/NGEET/fates/releases/tag/sci.1.52.0_api.20.0.0

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Developers should be aware that FATES does require information on the model timestep, which was not necessarily available in initialize1. Efforts were made to circumvent needing the model timetep at this phase of initialization, so impact on non-fates code was minimal.


Testing summary:
----------------
  regular tests (aux_clm: https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/System-Testing-Guide#pre-merge-system-testing):

    cheyenne ----  PASS (fates had expectedly different results compared to base)
    izumi -------  PASS (fates had expectedly different results compared to base)

  fates tests: (give name of baseline if different from CTSM tagname, normally fates baselines are fates-<FATES TAG>-<CTSM TAG>)
    cheyenne ---- PASS (fates had expectedly different results compared to base)
    izumi -------


   Additional tests:
	Multi-decadal simulations were also run to evaluate fates side sensitivity to slightly different averaging scheme. The differences were not so subtle, attributed mostly to fixing an initialization bug (the previous 24hour temperature had initialized at 0K) and a 1-hour phase change in the 24-hour start-stop cycle.


Answer changes

Changes answers relative to baseline:  all FATES active simulations have different results.

One-line Summary: Refactor static fire data input by moving variables into fire_base_type from cnveg_state_type

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag refactors the static fire data input methodology to enable a future anthropogenic fire suppression
methodology to FATES as described NGEET/fates#673. This future method requires that FATES have access to
GDP data that was previously defined in CNVegStateType.F90 as part of cnveg_state_type.  As such, the GDP
variable has been moved into fire_base_type in FireDataBaseType.F90 to provide the data to the extended
fates_fire_base_type for eventual use in FATES.  Similarly, the surface dataset read subroutine has been
moved along with the peat and ag-fire variables, which utilize the same read subroutine and where also
originally part of the cnveg_state_type.

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
    The ncd_io calls for the gdp, peat, and ag-fire data has been moved from the
    cnveg_state_type InitCold procedure into a new subroutine called surfdataread
    which is a new fire_base_type procedure.

    The function GetGDP has been introduced to get the pointer to the GDP data.  This has
    been implemented in clmfates_interfaceMod.F90, but the assignment of this pointer
    to a FATES-side bc_in variable has been commented out pending a future update to
    define the necessary FATES GDP variable.

    A new namelist option has been added to the fates_spitfire_mode series.  This option
    is intended as a simple placeholder for a future FATES fire supression mode.  The
    option is currently being included as a check in clmfates_interfaceMod.F90 to allow
    for the exercise of the GetGDP function.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag facilitates updates to FATES history variable names, units, other metadata,
and flushing behavior. Variables are now initially flushed to the CTSM ignore value,
then flushed to 0.0 on the FATES side.

Calls were added to flush_hvars and zero_site_hvars inside the
init_coldstart and restart subroutines in clmfates_interfaceMod.F90.
FATES history variables names were updated to the new names in the
user_nl_clm hist_fincl1 lists in the testmods directory.

  updated branch. This test confirms that the old variables can be matched
  to a new variable (except for a select few where we removed some
  variables due to duplication), and that when we did see changes in the
  output values, these changes were the expected factor differences based
  on the intended units change.

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Changes to tests or testing:

    Replaced the only f19 grid resolution testmod in the izumi fates list with an f45 test
    since the pes layout change for izumi from ctsm5.1.dev062 results in high resolution grids
    taking longer to run now.  Coverage for high resolution fates tests is provided via cheyenne
    test lists.

    For the same reasons as above, I transferred the only high res (f19) grid resolution testmod
    in the izumi aux_clm list to cheyenne to maintain coverage for this test.  The ctsm5.1.dev063
    aux_clm baseline on cheyenne has been updated to include this test.

One-line Summary: Make NUOPC the default driver rather than MCT

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Make NUOPC the default driver rather than MCT. Update externals and switch
tests so nuopc tests are explicit for mct. Fix several issues. Update the README
files and in-place documentation.

Remove MODEL as a setting for the build system, use COMP_NAME instead.
Adds a container machine definition in cime.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
   domain files are normally no longer used

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
  See README.NUOPC_driver.md for a description of what changes

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   New namelist added force_send_to_atm

Substantial timing or memory changes: A bit slower, but less overall memory
    The PFS test shows the following:
    Model Cost:             265.58   pe-hrs/simulated_year
    Model Throughput:       165.91   simulated_years/day
    The previous baseline for the MCT driver showed this
    Model Cost:             214.41   pe-hrs/simulated_year
    Model Throughput:       205.52   simulated_years/day
    The RUN length in TestStatus for dev05* and dev06* versions varied from 58 to 81 seconds
      so about up to a 20% variation
    Highwater memory mark is higher (67 vs 131 GB), and last usage (323 vs 165MB) lower than MCT


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
Changes to tests or testing:
   Switch nuopc tests for mct. Remove ctsm_sci tests on izumi. Set MOSART_MODE==NULL for spinup tests
   PTCLM and gen_domain tools tests removed

One-line Summary: Changes needed to get aux history output with cmeps

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

These changes are needed to create auxiliary land history files when the
new cmeps configuration variable is set to true. histaux_l2x1yrg =
.true.

The changes needed in CTSM enable lnd2glc fields to be sent to the
mediator even if glc is not present - based on querying the
histaux_l2x1yrg setting.

This includes a related change to set most lnd -> mediator fields to
spval over ocean, instead of sending zero values over ocean.

This tag corrects an accidental inclusion of non-debug, nag compiled fates testmods
into the izumi aux_clm test list.  It also makes corrections to the expected failures
list as well as adjusts the fates izumi test list as well as updates the externals
file to point to the most recent fates tag (which includes a science update so answers

Changes to tests or testing:

    Changed the non-debug fates testmods in the izumi aux_clm list to compile with intel
    instead of nag to avoid fates issue 771 and provide testing parity with the cheyenne
    aux_clm list.

    Removed two tests from the fates izumi test list:
      - FatesColdDefAllVars testmod as it takes too long to complete due to history writes
      - f19, 3-day, ERP fates testmod due to a sporadic memleak

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag changes the list of fates testmod represented in the aux_clm category test list
to provide an updated set of testmods to improve coverage and diversity of fates modes
to be checked during ctsm updates now that fates is updating directory to the ctsm main/master

NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Changes to tests or testing:
    - The list of fates testmods that are included as part of the aux_clm testlist has been updated to
      change older compset coverage for newer Clm50 compsets.  It also changes the list of fates testmods
      to improve coverage for stable fates run mode options.
    - The list of tests for the fates test category on all machines has been updated to use river stub compsets
      for most tests in an effort to reduce test runtime.
    - The list of tests for the fates test category on izumi has been change to only include debug-only tests as
      a short term work around for FATES #771
    - The output variables for most all fates testmods is updated to only include site-level variables in an
      effort to decrease history write time for any given test
    - Updates the expected failure test list to remove out-of-date entries failures
    - Many of the fates testmods have been renamed to be have a more broadly consistent naming scheme that denotes
      which testmod is a baseline for a given testmod
    - FatesColdDefLandUse testmod has been added to gain coverage for the do_harvest mode

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  stomatalcond_method is now Medlyn2011 for clm5_0 and clm5_1
  use_nitrif_denitrif is now TRUE when using FATES

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New parameter file for clm5_1 (changes ceta)

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  Surface datasets are now labeled with use_vichydro=TRUE in the xml. This also means that some files
  listed in the XML are listed twice for VIC both on and off (that's important for FATES since it still
  requires non-crop datasets (see #1505)

  Also the logic for finding both fsurdat and flanduse_timeseries files needs to be the same in first
  asking for a crop version and then an exact match if it isn't found (unless it's FATES and then you just
  do the exact match).

Changes to tests or testing:
  Dynamic lakes test now has methane on, which works because we turn off methane conservation check after restart
  See #43 for more information on this.

    - what code configurations: Most
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change:
        similar climate most changes are near roundoff level

    All clm5_1 physics change answers because of change in ceta parameter.
    When PHS off for clm5_1 and clm5_0 changes answers because of Medlyn photosynthesis over Ball-Berry.
    Photosynthesis potentially changes all the time because a maximum parameter was off.
    Answer should be close to roundoff for Sp and Bgc cases without Crop because we now use crop surface datasets.
    FATES changes answers since user_nitrif_dentrif is now on by default
    COLDSTART BGC cases will change answers because of a change in initial soil temperature
    clm4_5 and clm5_0 vichydro results are identical
    clm4_5 and clm5_0 single point urban tests are identical
    Some tests are still identical mostly crop-cases non-cold-start
    In some cases GSSUN and GSSHA will be different.

One-line Summary: FATES Satellite Phenology mode implemented

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This PR enables FATES TLAI, TSAI, and HTOP to be driven by the host land model
satellite data sets.  The parameter file has been updated to include an array
mapping the indices of the host land model pfts to fates pfts.  FATES satellite
phenology mode automatically enables two additional reduced complexity modes:
fixed biogeography and no competition.  The former had previously been
implimented although this update corrected an error associated with this mode.
The latter is a new mode introduced in this PR as well and a corresponding

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
  Adds FATES-SP mode as part of #1047 (a FATES v1 requirement)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include issue #):
  #1485 -- Forthcoming FATES satellite phenology ERS test fails COMPARE_base_rest
  #1488 -- FATES SP mode filter comparison: all_soil_patches and soil
  #1489 -- Add graceful build failure for additional modes that are incompatible with use_fates_sp

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include issue #):
  MOSART #45 -- frivinp_rtm is still required even if MOSART is turned off

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
  The SPITFIRE model is set to fail gracefully if accidentally enabled in conjunction with sp mode.
  There is a known error in the satellite phenology exact restart, so restarts should not be
  attempted until issue #1485 has been resolved.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
  History variables TLAI, TSAI, and HTOP are updated to reflect the fates sp mode outputs by means
  of overwriting the existing history outputs.  The original canopystate variables are still
  calculated, but not available to the user.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  Add namelist option: use_fates_sp, use_fates_nocomp

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New fates paramter file which include hlm to fates pft indexing map

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  All single site fates suite tests need to be manually built and submitted given MOSART #45.  PR #1275 will resolve
  this by switching to a non-MOSART compset.

Changes to tests or testing:
  A temporary SMS test has been added for Satellite Phenology testmod given the known ERS failure (issue #1485).

One-line Summary: New parameters on paramsfile, many bit-for-bit changes, new history fields for IWUELN,VPD_2M, allow Medlyn Photosynthesis for non-PHS cases, fixes to HumanStressIndex

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Brings more hardcoded parameters to the paramsfile. Some bit-for-bit cleanup. A fix for HumanStressIndex. Adding IWUELN
and VPD_2M diagnostic to history output. Add in ability to run Medlyn photosynthesis for non-PHS cases (not turned on yet though).
Most of the addition of parameters is from Keith Oleson.

Daniel Kennedy added two new diagnostic fields available for history outuput.
IWUELN: the intrinsic water use efficiency at local noon (umolCO2/molH2O)
VPD_2M: vapor pressure deficit at 2m reference height (pascals)

The Medlyn stomatal conductance functionality was deployed for CLM5. It had not been implemented for use_hydrstress=.false
(i.e.  SMS).  Previously if we opted for: use_hydrstress=.false and stomatalcond_method = 'Medlyn2011',
the model would actually use the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model. Daniel Kennedy adds the changes to allow this for
non-PHS.

Human Stress index changes are from Jonathan Buzan and Keith Oleson.

Some clean-up work on arctic vegetation changes. Also removal of the option to run non-CENTRY based soil
decomposition model. CN options are removed along with use_century_decomp and use_vertsoilc. use_nitrif_dentrif and
use_lch4 are still retained, but recommended to be always on, and will be removed later.

Partial work on #1356 (but use_lch4, use_nitrif_dentrif remain)

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include issue #):
  #1462 -- GSSUN and GSSHA are not set on history files
  #1460 -- Initialize t_soisno to 272K instead of 274K to avoid deep soil carbon in permafrost regions


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
  Vertical soil carbon is now hardcoded to on. This means that if you had run a simulation
  with it turned off -- you won't be able to use it's restart files in this versions and after.
  Likewise with CENTURY-BGC.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
  Removed namelist options: wrtdia, use_vertsoilc, use_century_decomp, min_wind_snowcompact
  Added namelist options:   min_critical_dayl_method, soil_decomp_method
    New options for min_critical_dayl_method, DependsOnVeg and DependsOnLatAndVeg

  Remove 1x1_camdenNJ and 1x1_asphaltjungleNJ grid options
  Remove some uneeded grids and files, correct 360x720cru grid for mksurfdata_map
  Remove vestiges of ch4 files in mksurfdata_map
  Remove the "cn" option to "-bgc" in CLM_BLDNML_OPTS and remove Cn compsets and tests

  New history variables: VPD2M, IWUELN (FV made default active)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New parameter files

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   After we turn on methane and nitrfication-dentrification for all configurations we
   can remove the use_lch4 and use_nitrif_denitrif options

Changes to tests or testing:
    Removed CN and 1x1_camdenNJ tests as well as NoVSNoNI
    Shortened 1x1_cancouverCAN test as it ran beyond the end of data
    Changed name of "rootlit" test to "anoxia" as that was the only thing it does, it now
      also runs with vertical soil Carbon profile

One-line Summary: Wrapper script for running NEON sites, and some NEON updates

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This is a wrapper script for running CTSM simulation for one or more neon sites using
CIME case objects.

This script accomplishes the following:

Downloads and parses neon listing file for the available neon data :
https://neon-ncar.s3.data.neonscience.org/listing.csv

Create a base generic case and clone other cases from this generic base case.

Enable the user to run in AD, Post-AD, and transient mode.

Currently, there is no case dependency or case status check in the code. Which means
that the user cannot run Post-AD +AD + transient all at the same time. If we add case
dependency, then the code that checks the status of a case (e.g. spinup) every 2
seconds and once it is finished successfully submit the next phase (e.g. transient.)

Externals are also updated to fix some NEON issues.

New tools subdirectory site_and_regional and current scripts for handling single-point
moved underneath. Also README files and tools testing changed for this move. Also tools
test added for the new wrapper script talked about above. Fix an issue in subset_data.py
where it couldn't be run from outside of a git directory because it checks for the git hash.

Changes so that CTSM will write restarts as signaled at end of simulation by the CMEPS mediator.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, just roundoff-level for pgi

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: anything with LUNA
    - what platforms/compilers: pgi
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

     I verified that the answer changes just arise due to an extra
     multiplication by 1 in LUNA, which must change order of operations
     for pgi. (I compared with this one-off from master and was
     bit-for-bit:

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Following from the changes in ctsm5.1.dev047 to change the lower bounds
to 1 on all processors: The one downside of that change was that it made
it a bit harder to write diagnostics on a given point. This PR cleans up
the method for writing these diagnostics and adds relevant

One-line Summary: Update externals, NEON updates, fix stop_option=date, move neon niwo test to match user_mods, local time option

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Move the NEON_NIWO test to NEON/NIWO to match the names in usermods. Output particular fields for the NEON
cases, and use a reduced size dataset for lightning for NEON sites. Update NEON surface datasets with
new scripts included here. Fix stop option for NUOPC. NEON NIWO test in testlist explicity uses the user-mod
as well as the defaults testmod.

This script is for modifying the surface dataset at neon sites using data available from the neon server.

Also add the ability to output history fields for a particular time of day (in seconds) with the LXXXXX
history averaging option from Ronny Meier.

Externals are updated extensively to the version with cpl7 cime directories split out for CESM.

One-line Summary: Make certain history fields descriptive inst. of labeling by number

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 I used existing infrastructure to add descriptive strings to certain history
 fields that I had labeled by number in #1340. While doing this, I applied the
 change to a bunch of other history fields that needed it.

 Some variable names for pools was also changed to use terms consistent with the new
 names as well.

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
 The names of certain history fields have changed to be more descriptive
 in place of using numbers to differentiate them.

One-line Summary: Start bounds at 1; remove references to MCT

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Users: take note of (1), and in particular the caveat for users noted
below (in the "Notes of particular relevance for users").

(1) All global index arrays on a given processor now have a starting index of 1
  - bounds_proc for each subgrid level has a starting index of 1 for each level
  - bounds_clump for each subgrid level has a starting index of 1 for just
    the first clump on the processor - but all the other clumps on the
    processor do not start at 1 - but rather are offset with the number of
    gridcells, columns, ...etc on the preceeding clumps

(2) There are no longer any references to any mct data structures other than in the mct cap
  - All references to gsmap have been removed from decompMod.F90 and
    replaced with new global index arrays for the various subgrid levels
  - decompInitMod has been refactored to calculated these global index
    arrays using pure MPI rather than mct
  - ncdio_pio_F90.in has been refactored to use the new global index
    arrays rather than the gsmap data structures
  - the data struture ldecomp is no longer needed
  - the module spmdGathScatMod.F90 is no longer needed and has been removed

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------
Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Addresses the first part of ESCOMP/CTSM#293 (Rework threading to be
  done at a higher level, simplifying array argument passing)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Until now, if the model produced an error message with a gridcell or
  subgrid index (e.g., "Error at p = 1234"), you could rerun the model
  with write statements in conditionals like "if (p == 1234) then". With
  the changes in this tag, this simple conditional is no longer
  possible. Instead, you will need to also reference the processor
  number that produces the error.

  If the error message is produced in the lnd log file, then you can
  have a conditional like:
    if (masterproc .and. p == 1234) then

  If the error message is produced in the cesm log file, then you can
  have a conditional like:
    if (iam == X .and. p == 1234) then

  where X is the processor number that produced the message. On some
  machines (including cheyenne), this processor number is printed at the
  start of each line in the cesm log file. In addition, some aborts will
  now print "proc_id = X", and that value can be used.

  Soon we will update
  https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/users_guide/trouble-shooting/trouble-shooting.html
  to document the new recommended procedure.

One-line Summary: Include CWD in heterotrophic respiration (HR)

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 Params file sets the respiration fractions for CWD to zero:
 rf_cwdl2_bgc = 0
 rf_cwdl3_bgc = 0
 The model has no code to handle rf_cwd* > 0. So...
 - I have introduced cwdhr_col to track this HR the same way that we track
 lithr_col for litter.
 - I have removed if-statements that prevented CWD HR pools and decomposition
 from writing to history.
 - I have introduced a new test to the cheyenne test-suite that makes active
 seven history fields pertaining to CWD HR and points to a params file with
 rf_cwd* > 0. I have confirmed that the new test returns the new active
 variables as greater than 0 when pointing to the new params file and equal
 to 0 when pointing to the default params file.

One-line Summary: New stream functionality when using NUOPC or LILAC

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag creates new stream functionality when using the NUOPC and LILAC
caps, and maintains backwards compatibility with the older CPL7 stream
functionality when using the MCT cap.

- New stream code has been placed in src/cpl/share_esmf (so that they
  can also be leveraged by LILAC)
- Older stream code for mct is now in src/cpl/mct
- LILAC interface has been changed to leverage the new stream code as well

Where possible share code was used. In particular, this holds for SatellitePhenologyMod.F90.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Substantial timing or memory changes: None for mct. For
ERS_Ly3_P72x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput,
overall run time is slightly less than the baseline - probably within
machine variability. A more careful investigation would be needed to
determine if the CDEPS streams have changed performance significantly
relative to the MCT-based streams, but the overall timing suggests that
there probably aren't *large* differences.

 k_frag to k_frag_cn in the params file according to the models that use
 these parameters.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
 initial_Cstocks_depth_bgc and initial_Cstocks_bgc are not namelist
 variables anymore.

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 There are new params files for clm45, clm50, and ctsm51.

    izumi ------- OK (read below in "other testing" about pgi failures)

  any other testing (give details below):
 Two unexpected tests fail on izumi, so I performed additional testing.
 The tests that fail:
 1) SMS_D.f10_f10_mg37.I2000Clm51BgcCrop.izumi_pgi.clm-crop
 BASELINE ctsm5.1.dev042: DIFF roundoff
 2) SMS.f10_f10_mg37.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.izumi_pgi.clm-crop
 BASELINE ctsm5.1.dev042: DIFF greater than roundoff for CH4-related vars
 I confirmed same result with my earlier commit against BASELINE dev033.

 Same tests but with gnu/intel instead of pgi pass on izumi for both
 comparisons to dev042 and to dev033. These tests are part of the izumi
 test-suite already.

 Additional testing:
 Repeated these gnu/intel tests (had to run for baseline first) on cheyenne
 and they passed.

One-line Summary: Updates to coupling interface to enable FATES-CH4, and to be compatible with FATES-CNP.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

These changes are only relegated to the API with FATES. Boundary conditions were prepared within
FATES to enable proper use of the methane model. Further, some minor changes were made to the FATES
interface code (clmfates_interfaceMod.F90) allowing compatibility with FATES tag sci.1.46.0_api.16.0.0
(https://github.com/NGEET/fates/releases/tag/sci.1.46.0_api.16.0.0). Most of these changes have to do
with how the FATES history interface is instantiated.

One-line Summary: Replace masked with "nomask" SRC files for use with mkmapdata and mksurfdata_map

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 1) Collapse multiple source (SRC) files of a given resolution to a
 single "nomask" SRC file per SRC resolution. The mask variable is now
 set to 1 everywhere in all SRC files and mkmapdata.sh generates
 a single map_ file (aka weight file) per destination (DST) resolution.
 2) The executable mksurfdata_map now applies the SRC mask found in the
 raw datasets, since the map_ files do not contain this information.

 These changes simplify the introduction of new surface variables with
 raw data in one of our existing SRC resolutions because we need not
 create new SRC files for such variables. To introduce new surface
 variables with raw data in new resolutions, the corresponding new SRC
 files need mask equal to 1 everywhere.

 NOTE: Answer-changing modifications have been made in mksurfdata_map,
 but we have NOT recreated the out-of-the-box surface datasets. This
 means that, if you create new surface datasets, you should expect small
 answer changes relative to the current out-of-the-box surface datasets.

Significant changes to scientifically-supported configurations

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #286


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
 These changes are transparent to users making surface datasets using
 default SRC resolutions. Users using non-default SRC resolutions or
 users introducing new surface variables with raw data in non-default
 SRC resolutions, will create new SRC file(s) with mask always set to 1
 everywhere.

 Note, though, that the out-of-the-box surface datasets now differ
 slightly from what you would produce by running mksurfdata_map. So
 answer changes should be expected relative to the out-of-the-box
 surface datasets if you create a new surface dataset.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
 Changed the names of most default SRC files and default map_ files to
 the names of the "nomask" versions of these files.

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 Replaced SRC files and map_ files with "nomask" versions. Most SRC
 resolutions already had nomask files available, so I created such files
 for 0.25x0.25, 0.9x1.25, 3x3min, 5x5min, and 0.125x0.125. I changed all
 of the map_ files except
 map_1km-merge-10min_HYDRO1K-merge-nomask SRC resolution.
 I ran the rimport command as follows:
 ./rimport -list /glade/work/slevis/git/mksurfdata_maps_wo_src_masks/PR_823_new_file_list

Substantial timing or memory changes:
 - We end up with fewer SRC and map_ files by replacing multiple custom
 grids per SRC resolution with one nomask grid. I list here resolutions
 that had multiple custom grids per resolution before the switch to
 nomask:
 0.5x0.5: AVHRR, MODIS, and 360x720cru_cruncep
 3x3min: GLOBE-Gardner-mergeGIS, GLOBE-Gardner, LandScan2004, MODIS-wCsp
 5x5min: IGBP-GSDP, ISRIC-WISE, ORNL
 10x10min_IGBPmergeICESatGIS

 UNSTRUCT info shown for comparison. NOT switching to UNSTRUCT files at
 this time.

 - The nomask map_ files are larger now. E.g.:
2754246572 map_3x3min_GLOBE-Gardner_to_0.9x1.25_nomask_aave_da_c191101.nc  MASKED SCRIP
3051641404 map_3x3min_nomask_to_0.9x1.25_nomask_aave_da_c191109.nc         NOMASK SCRIP
2974797264 map_3x3min_nomask_to_0.9x1.25_nomask_aave_da_c191115.nc         NOMASK UNSTRUCT

 - Although the nomask SCRIP cases shown below are slower because each
 individual mapping file takes longer to create, the total time to
 generate mapping files is reduced, possibly significantly, due to the
 need for fewer mapping files in total. Note the increase in time
 savings from the 0.5x0.5 to the 10x10min resolution, which suggests
 even greater time savings for the 3x3min and 5x5min that went from a
 total of 7 to 2 map_ files. Sample timing data:

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- The out-of-the-box surface datasets now differ slightly from what you
  would produce by running mksurfdata_map. So answer changes should be
  expected relative to the out-of-the-box surface datasets if you create
  a new surface dataset.
- We were not able to run the check_maps tool on the new mapping files:
  this generated a seg fault (see
  https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/823#issuecomment-846248591)

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, but for now the model results
are the same: there will be changes to surface datasets when they are
remade, but so far we are still pointing to unchanged out-of-the-box
surface datasets.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change: larger than roundoff/same climate

 For now, model results are unchanged because we are still using the old
 surface datasets. However, this tag changes answers in any new surface
 datasets that are created.

 I performed testing at the 0.9x1.25 degree resolution.

 Code changes were tested by comparing baseline files (a)
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.nc
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.log
 generated by running baseline code pointing to masked map_ files
 to (b)
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_new_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.nc
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_new_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.log
 generated by running the new code still pointing to masked map_ files
 and then comparing to (c)
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_nomask_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.nc
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_nomask_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.log
 generated by running the new code pointing to nomask map_ files.

 We set an expectation of max abs relative differences of less than
 roughly 1e-13. I got an actual max abs relative difference of 7e-12 in
 PCT_NAT_PFT for (a) vs (b) and (a) vs (c). I refer to these here as
 small diffs.

 All other variables gave smaller diffs except the four VIC variables
 binfil, Ws, Ds, Dsmax between (b) and (c). These diffs appear in 5 grid
 cells (along two meridians that got shifted in longitude by less than
 1e-13 degrees) that vic considers land in the baseline and
 ocean in the nomask case. Vic provides valid generic data for ocean
 grid cells and, therefore, also where the discrepancies occur. This
 means that if the land model treats these grid cells as land, the
 model will work.

 I had to generate new masked map_ files for (a) and (b) because
 changes in ESMF codes over the years were leading to large differences
 between all three (a) vs (b) vs (c). Generating new masked map_ files
 brought the diffs back to small.

 For the 3x3min and 5x5min SRC resolutions, I made six temporary
 nomask SRC files, one per surface variable pointing to 3x3min
 map_ files and one per surface variable pointing to 5x5min map_ files.
 I did this to get small differences relative to the baseline. I created
 the temporary files by making copies of the correspoding masked SRC
 files and changing mask to 1 everywhere. The temporary files had diffs
 less than roughly 1e-5 from generic nomask files generated by running
 mkscripgrid.ncl for 3x3min and 5x5min. Ultimately we are replacing the
 temporary files with the generic nomask files, which leads to larger
 diffs in the surface datasets.

 This testing occurred in late 2019 or early 2020. To confirm the
 results I generated a new set of map_ files for 0.9x1.25 and then
 created new fsurdat files with the baseline code and with the branch.
 Only PCT_NAT_PFT triggers the error check for max abs relative
 diff > 1e-13 with a max abs relative diff = 9e-12.

One-line Summary: Add NEON sites

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Add NEON sites. Add cime/cdeps support and capability to run NEON tower sites.

This also brings in Negin's first version of the subset_data.py script to create
datasets for single-point and regional cases. And a version of it was run to
create the NEON surface datasets.

To setup a NEON site do the following

cd cime/scripts
./create_newcase --case myNEONtest --res CLM_USRDAT --compset IHist1PtClm51Bgc \
--user-mods-dir NEON/NIWO --driver nuopc --run-unsupported

(There's also a I1PtClm51Bgc compset that can be used for fixed conditions)

Note, also that several externals were updated to the version in cesm2_3_alpha03a. This means that
answers change when CISM is turned on. Some of the grids for compsets tested were updated to
use the new grid name "gris" in place of the older "gland".

One-line Summary: Correct vertical interpolation in init_interp when soil thicknesses change

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 To correct how init_interp handles soil variables with units of kg/m2 or mm
 or mm/s (generally speaking so-called extensive properties), we now add DZSOI
 and a scale_by_thickness flag to restart files. In init_interp we use these to
 scale the vertical interpolation by soil layer thickness.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
 For H2OSOI_LIQ, H2OSOI_ICE, SMP, and HK, from now on init_interp interpolates
 from the soil profile in finidat to the soil profile in the model by
 scaling these variables by dzsoi (layer thickness). This makes the vertical
 interpolation of these variables more accurate. Users need not do anything.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 From now on newly generated finidat files will contain the scale_by_thickness
 flag and DZSOI for use by the new code. For backwards compatibility, the code
 handles preexisting finidat files by deriving dzsoi from the node depths for
 the four variables listed above.

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

This tag updates the way in which fates is called during restarts to appropriately
handle the fates-side snow occlusion code.  Additionally, this update points to the
most recent fates tag, which includes a number of fates science updates (including
the snow occlusion fix) and fates-side bug fixes (see below for list of issues
addressed).

One-line Summary: Misc bfb enhancements and fixes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

(1) If CISM is running over Antarctica, use virtual glacier columns over
    Antarctica

(2) Remove "mec" from some glacier/ice variable names (it is misleading
    to have "mec" in variable names when the ice landunit can actually
    have multiple columns *or* a single column) (ESCOMP/CTSM#1294)

(3) Add history file metadata on each variable's l2g_scale_type (adds a
    landunit_mask attribute) (ESCOMP/CTSM#1343)

(4) Use python3 in more shebang lines - needed to run python unit tests
    on cheyenne

(5) New compset naming for IG compsets (ESCOMP/CTSM#1289)

(6) Remove calculation of fun_cost_fix that is overwritten
    (ESCOMP/CTSM#1115)

(7) Bypass grid-level water mass check when fates hydro is active
    (ESCOMP/CTSM#1334)

(8) Remove some dead code (ESCOMP/CTSM#1333)

Notes of particular relevance for users

[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- Renamed maxpatch_glcmec to maxpatch_glc

Substantial timing or memory changes:
- Increase in land initialization time in the PFS test
  (PFS_Ld20.f09_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel); this is probably
  due to machine variability because I don't think any of the changes in
  this tag would have any significant impact on model initialization
  time.

One-line Summary: Bring in Arctic changes to LUNA from Leah Birch

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This is @lmbirch89 branch from #947 with the exception that Kattge is used in place of
Leuning in LUNA. Also the startup initial values in the luna bug fix branch #961 is
used in place of the updated values by @lmbirch89. The LUNA bug fixes have already come
in, so these are some changes to improve arctic plants.

We have addressed the issues in phenology and photosynthesis in the high latitudes.
Development was focused on PFT specific differences and we used observations to inform
model development. GPP is improved now such that the tundra is realistically less
productive than the boreal forest.

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):

   Fixes #1307 -- Turn on reseed_dead_plants when you start AD spinup mode

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include issue #):
  #1346 -- Use of floating point flag onset_thresh is confusing in CNPhenologyMod

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   New namelist items: onset_thresh_depends_on_veg and min_crtical_dayl_depends_on_lat

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  reseed_dead_plants turned on when AD spinup mode turned on
  onset_thresh_depends_on_veg and min_crtical_dayl_depends_on_lat turned on for clm5_1 physics

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New parameter file (same as start used in PPE work) also has additional fields on it

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  As noted in #1346 some of the logic in CNPhenology in CNSeasonDecidPhenology is a bit confusing.
   The soil layer used was put in CNSharedParameters and needed it's own subroutine to prevent circular dependencies.
   There are new accumulator variables added that area always turned on even when not needed. Doing this
   in a reasonable manner (without having lots of CNPhenology logic spilled into base types) would require
   a refactoring of a better way to figure this out.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Remove setting of nextsw_cday in initialization: this hasn't been needed
ever since we stopped calculating albedos in initialization.

Also remove nextsw_cday from clm_time_manager: this was being set but
was never referenced from here: instead, nextsw_cday was being passed as
an argument to clm_drv.

Also, updates cime to a branch tag where I have fixed the --retry option

One-line Summary: Fix bugs in co2 from atmosphere

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

ctsm5.1.dev002 introduced bugs when receiving co2 from the atmosphere,
both for mct and nuopc:
- For mct, with spatially-varying co2 from atmosphere, all grid cells on
  a given processor were given the co2 value from the last grid cell on
  that processor
- For nuopc, co2 from atmosphere was ignored and overridden with a
  constant co2 value

This tag fixes both of those bugs.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

    - what code configurations: Cases where CTSM receives CO2 from atmosphere
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      potentially new climate

   Answer changes due to fixing these issues:
   - For mct, with spatially-varying co2 from atmosphere, all grid cells on
     a given processor were given the co2 value from the last grid cell on
     that processor
   - For nuopc, co2 from atmosphere was ignored and overridden with a
     constant co2 value

   In the test suite, this leads to changes in:
   - ERP_D_Ld10_P36x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm51BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-ciso_decStart
   - ERS_Ly3_P72x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput
   - SMS_D_Ln9_P480x1_Vnuopc.f19_g17.IHistClm50Sp.cheyenne_intel.clm-waccmx_offline

   But more widespread changes are expected - including for mct - if
   coupled runs can generate spatially-varying co2 from atm

Answer changes

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES (but very limited)

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: NUOPC driver with CISM
    - what platforms/compilers: cheyenne_intel; maybe others
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): roundoff

    For an unknown reason, the new externals lead to small differences
    in global sums in the CMEPS driver/mediator. For what we assume is
    the same reason, lnd -> glc fields can change by roundoff (probably
    due to the global renormalization).

    The only test in the aux_clm test suite where this shows up is
    ERS_Ly3_P72x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse

One-line Summary: New single column functionality for the NUOPC cap

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Implemented new nuopc/cmeps single column functionality.

In config/cesm/config_files.xml - single point domains are only used
for mct/cpl7. For cmeps single point meshes are now generated on the
fly and component domains files are no longer needed.
env_run.xml variables PTS_LAT, PTS_LON and PTS_DOMAINFILE are used
to determine if there is a single point or single column run.
If PTS_LAT and PTS_LON are not -999 and PTS_DOMAINFILE is UNSET,
then you have a single point run and the exact values of PTS_LAT
and PTS_LON are used.  If PTS_LAT and PTS_LON are not -999 and
PTS_DOMAINFILE is not UNSET, then then the cmeps driver will recognize the nearest neighbor
values of PTS_LAT and PTS_LON in PTS_DOMAINFILE as the single column lat and lon to use.

Sublimation from top soil layer and evaporation/sublimation from top
snow layer needs to be limited to ensure moisture states do not become
negative. The original formulation did not always work, so we added a
new limitation to SoilFluxesMod.

Also removes a limitation in SoilHydrologyMod that seemed not to
conserve energy and should no longer be necessary with the reworked
limitation in SoilFluxesMod.

Significant changes to scientifically-supported configurations

[ ] clm4_5


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1253 (h2osoi_ice can go significantly negative)


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- The old flux limitation in SoilHydrologyMod has been replaced by a
  truncation of roundoff-level values followed by a check that the final
  state is non-negative. Although this check hasn't been triggered in
  any of our testing, it's possible that we'll run into situations where
  we need to relax the tolerance for this check.

One-line Summary: Update cime and other externals; includes switch to pio2

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Updates cime and other externals to version in cesm2_3_alpha02b (with
some minor changes to cime on top of that). This includes substantial
changes to cime, including switching to PIO2 rather than PIO1.

Also:

- For LILAC, changes default pio_rearranger now that we're using PIO2 by
  default

- In run_sys_tests, adds '-k oed' to qsub command on cheyenne; this is
  useful now that qpeek is disabled on cheyenne (this puts the job's
  stdout and stderr files directly in their final location from the
  beginning, rather than keeping them in some temporary location on the
  compute node until the job completes)

[ ] clm5_1

[ ] clm5_0

[ ] ctsm5_0-nwp

[ ] clm4_5


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1175 (Once there is a cime tag with pio2 as the
  default, update to it)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1194 (Once we switch to pio2 by default, change
  the default rearranger used in LILAC)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- PIO2 is now the default. This has been tested extensively, but let us
  know if you run into any I/O related issues. Also, from testing we've
  done, I/O performance looks better than with PIO1 in many cases, but
  also let us know if you see a substantial degradation in I/O
  performance.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
- Some I/O-related defaults change with the use of PIO2 rather than PIO1

Substantial timing or memory changes:
- Various changes due to the change to PIO2, some of them large. For the
  most part, timing improves with PIO2, particularly for production
  resolutions.
- The PFS test and many others show a substantial improvement in timing.
  This is especially noticeable in initialization time. For example, the
  initialization time of
  PFS_Ld20.f09_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel dropped from 111 sec
  to 34 sec. (These tests were run a couple of weeks apart, before and
  after a cheyenne upgrade, so there may be some machine variability in
  these numbers, but I saw a big improvement a few months ago with a
  more objective comparison.)

Testing summary:
----------------

One-line Summary: Calculate leaf biomass for non-woody PFTS, and a few other small answer changes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Replace hard code constant 0.25 for leaf mass per area with calculation based on parameter slatop (specific leaf area, top of
canopy). Also move num_iter into loop over patches; currently it sits outside a loop, so p index is incorrect.

Also do some small answer changes in terms of new parameter files, and some other existing issues that have mild answer changes.

    Note also that NAG compiler production tests started failing because of a compiler error
    Since, we only care about NAG for DEBUG testing we removed those tests. Hopefully, a compiler
    update will allow that to work in the future.

Changes to tests or testing:
  - Added FatesPRT2 testmod test which activates fates CNP mode
  - Added FatesReducedComplexFixedBiogeo testmod which activates fates fixed biogeography mode
  - Added FatesSizeAgeMort testmod which activates tracking of size and age dependent mortality in fates
  - Added Fates_nat_and_anthro_ignitions testmod to activate use of external lightning and population datasets
  - Non-debug mode nag tests replaced in izumi test list with debug versions due to internal compiler error.

One-line Summary: Add option for biomass heat storage (BHS) to clm5_1 physics

Purpose of changes
------------------

Add heat stored in biomass (for trees and shrubs) to the surface energy balance calculation. Add
a switch for it and turn it on by default for clm5_1 physics. It's turned off for clm4_5, clm5_0
physics and when FATES is turned on. Those cases are identical to before, answers only change
when it's turned on.

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
    New variables are added on the restart files (stem/leaf biomass and stem Temp)
    Testing didn't show this as a problem, but theoretically could require
       updating initial conditions

       TAF, QAF, OBU, ZETA, VPD, num_iter, RB, TSTEM
   DHSDT_CANOPY, TSTEM are default active

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): New use_biomass_heat_storage
   New namelist item: use_biomass_heat_storage to turn on or off (by default only on for clm5_1
   physics for both SP and BGC modes)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): New parameter datasets
   All of the params files were updated. New terms were BHS parameters and taper
   stocking is now set as "nstem" on the parameter file
   taper is now on the parameter file

Substantial timing or memory changes: Doesn't seem to
   Only one short test failed the TPUTCOMP test
   Longer tests were not significantly different

---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

One-line Summary: Potential roundoff changes in preparation for bio-mass heat storage option

Purpose of changes
------------------

This adds in some changes that may be roundoff different in preparation for bringing in the changes
that allow turning on the bio-mass heat storage option. There's a few zeroed terms added to some calculations
in CanopyFluxes. The new terms are identical to what will come in for BHS except the zeroed terms are
not arrays here but scalars. I showed the new terms are only off by roundoff with a previous commit that added
explicit tests for the terms and verified it for two tests.

One-line Summary: Fix ndep from coupler

Purpose of changes
------------------

There was a bug in ndep forcing (forc_ndep_grc) when receiving ndep from
CAM (ndep_from_cpl true). This first appeared in ctsm5.1.dev002. NDEP
forcings have been garbage since then when receiving ndep from CAM.

This tag fixes that issue.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1233 (ndep forcing incorrect when receiving ndep
  from CAM (starting with ctsm5.1.dev002))

One-line Summary: Allow pnetcdf for vector history files

Purpose of changes
------------------

Ever since clm4_5_1_r091, we had been avoiding the use of pnetcdf for
vector history files (i.e., history files with dov2xy = .false.). This
was to workaround an issue that was found on the old yellowstone
supercomputer (bugzilla 1730). However, I cannot reproduce this issue on
cheyenne, either with PIO1 or with PIO2. Moreover, the workaround was
leading to very slow performance with PIO2, at least for some
tests. This tag removes that old workaround.

See https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/33 for details.

Also change PE layouts for C96 and C192. The main motivation for this is
to get the aux_clm C96 test through the queue faster (the current test
sometimes waits for multiple hours in the queue):

(1) Make the out-of-the-box PE counts unthreaded, as is standard for I
    compsets

(2) In the aux_clm test for C92, use a 360x2 PE layout: Use a PE layout
    that (a) has threading, because CAM uses threading at this
    resolution; and (b) has a smaller-than-standard task count in order
    to get through the queue faster.

   runtime of these increased in some tests and decreased in others
   relative to the baseline, but on average, there was little change
   relative to the baseline. I have more carefully investigated this
   change in the context of pio2, which will soon become the default:
   with pio2, this change is important to get good performance.

One-line Summary: Allow nlevgrnd < nlevurb

Purpose of changes
------------------

Allow nlevgrnd < nlevurb. This will become more important soon, when
nlevurb is increased to 10, yet we want to allow simple soil layer
structures, e.g., for NWP applications.

Also some additions to ncdio-related utilities to support this,
including extending find_var_on_file to support dimensions as well as
variables.

Also add levsoi coordinate variable on history files.

One-line Summary: Change CISM2%NOEVOLVE compsets to use SGLC; documentation updates

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Change CISM2%NOEVOLVE compsets to use SGLC.

The use of CISM2%NOEVOLVE adds complexity and (perhaps most importantly)
increases the turnaround time of CTSM software testing, while adding
only marginal scientific value. Therefore, we are changing I compsets to
use a stub glacier (SGLC) rather than CISM2%NOEVOLVE for now. Within the
next year, we'd like to have these use a data glc model, but that will
most likely wait until we switch to using NUOPC by default (so we can
use a data glc in CDEPS: ESCOMP/CDEPS#25).

This tag changes the meaning of compset aliases that previously had
neither a Gs (for stub glacier) or G (for CISM2%EVOLVE), so that they
now use a stub glacier (SGLC) rather than CISM2%NOEVOLVE. Compset
aliases that previously had Gs (so were already using a stub glacier)
have been changed so that there is no longer a Gs in the alias: stub
glacier is now the implied default.

This change reduces our test build time to 40% of what it previously
was! When I ran the test suite for ctsm5.1.dev010, the cheyenne-intel
test suite (by far the largest of our test suites) took 5 hours, 8 min
to build. In yesterday's run of the test suite with this change in
place, the cheyenne-intel test suite took only 2 hours, 6 min to build!
The final test in this test suite finished running just 2 hours, 29 min
after I started the test suite. This may not be a completely fair
comparison, because the machine may have been relatively lightly loaded
during this Sunday afternoon run, but I wouldn't expect the test suite
build time (which is what I'm reporting here) to be hugely impacted by
that.

Changes due to using SGLC in place of CISM2%NOEVOLVE are documented
here:
<https://escomp.github.io/cism-docs/cism-in-cesm/versions/master/html/clm-cism-coupling.html?highlight=sglc#stub-glc-model-cism-absent>.

(2) Documentation updates

Brings in a new optional external, doc-builder, to assist with building
the documentation, specifically with a new Docker-based workflow
documented here
<https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/Directions-for-editing-CLM-documentation-on-github-and-sphinx>.

Also updates LILAC documentation and a bit more.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      Larger than roundoff; potentially new climate regionally, over Greenland

      The changes arise from changes in the meaning of
      compsets. Configurations that used to use a stub GLC (compsets
      with Gs in their alias) have the same meaning as before, but a
      different compset alias (so in testing, this resulted in BFAILs
      due to missing baselines). Configurations that previously used
      CISM2%NOEVOLVE (which included most of our standard
      configurations) now instead use a stub GLC. This results in
      differences over Greenland (in ways described here:
      <https://escomp.github.io/cism-docs/cism-in-cesm/versions/master/html/clm-cism-coupling.html?highlight=sglc#stub-glc-model-cism-absent>).

One-line Summary: Fix reading netcdf variable into a different data type

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is to fix the reading of a variable that is one type on a
NetCDF file but a different data type in memory. Previously, this could
lead to memory corruption (not just of the variable in question, but
other variables as well). This was not causing any problems in
out-of-the-box configurations, but it sometimes tripped up some
developers when they added new fields on datasets.

In addition, this adds new self-test code to test ncdio_pio. This module
is hard to get under unit test, but we want to have some tests of it, to
pick up problems like the one fixed in this tag. So as a compromise
solution for now, I have introduced unit test-like tests that are built
into a standard build of CTSM and run in a standard run if a given
namelist flag is set. A better long-term solution would be to integrate
these tests into the pFUnit-based unit testing framework, but that would
take some work. I have added tests of the new code, and a bit of testing
of other code in ncdio_pio, but there's still a lot in ncdio_pio that is
not tested. I figure we can gradually add tests as we make changes to
ncdio_pio.

Finally, an unrelated change to the unit test build: files generated by
genf90 now appear in the unit test build directory rather than the
source tree.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1091 (Memory corruption when reading a netcdf
  variable into a variable of a different type, at least with PIO1)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1188 (In unit test build: files generated by
  genf90 should go in build dir rather than source dir)

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Ideally the ncdio_pio self-tests would be recoded as true unit tests,
  leveraging the pFUnit framework. This would get them out of the main
  source code, and would give other benefits that come with a real unit
  testing framework, such as that a single failure doesn't abort the
  entire test suite.
- The existence of tests for ncdio_pio should NOT be taken as a sign
  that all (or even most) of this module is now under unit test: in
  fact, much of it is not covered yet by my new testing module.

One-line Summary: CNFire: btran2 fixes and general cleanup

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Call routine to calculate fire's btran2 from CNFireArea; this has a
    few advantages:

    - It makes the logic of CNFireArea more clear (rather than depending on
      a btran2 variable that is calculated from some other part of the code)

    - This avoids having the biogeophysics depend on the biogeochemistry

    - This lets us avoid doing this btran calc if using no-fire – or other,
      future, fire methods that don't need it

    Note regarding testing: In the initial step, I kept this calculation
    dependent on a saved version of h2osoi_vol to avoid changing
    answers; I changed this in the answer changes in step (2), as noted
    below.

(2) Answer-changing fixes to CNFire's btran2 calculation and use:

    (a) Calculate fire btran2 using updated h2osoi_vol (this is an
        answer-changing cleanup step from (1))

    (b) TEMPORARY CHANGE (reverted in the cleanup in (3)): Reinitialize
        fire btran2 to spval for all patches in each time step, so that
        the fire code isn't trying to use btran2 from earlier time steps
        for patches that were in the exposed veg filter at one point but
        no longer are.

        One implication of this is that, if there is currently no
        exposed veg on a column, the new code leads to the block of code
        that forces fire_m = 0 (because wtlf will be 0). Previously, in
        contrast, it looks like fire_m was allowed to be non-zero even
        if there is currently no exposed veg, because btran2 and wtlf
        were accumulated if a patch ever was exposed in the past.

    (c) Limit fire btran2 to be <= 1, rather than letting it be slightly
        greater than 1. (Due to a conditional in CNFireArea, these
        slightly-greater-tan-1 values were being ignored when computing
        btran_col, rather than averaging in a 1 value.)

(3) Non-answer-changing fire code cleanup:

    (a) Cleanup of the btran2 fixes, including reverting the TEMPORARY
        CHANGE noted in (2b), instead relying on a better mechanism:
        just doing the calculations of btran_col and wtlf over the
        exposedvegp filter. Also, get rid of the checks for
        shr_infnan_isnan(btran2(p)) and btran2(p) <= 1 (allowed by the
        other changes in (2) and (3)).

    (b) Set btran2 to 0 over non-exposed-veg points: this changes
        answers for the BTRAN2 diagnostic field, but nothing else. (This
        follows what is done for the standard BTRAN.)

    (c) Move calc_fire_root_wetness for CNFireLi2021 into the base type
        to avoid future bugs (assuming that the next fire module will
        extend the base class but will also want to use this new version
        of calc_fire_root_wetness).

    (d) Change fire looping structure to be more standard

(4) Remove some very expensive tests from aux_clm, putting some in the
    new ctsm_sci test list instead

(5) A bit of other minor cleanup

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1139 (Decrease expense of ne0ARCTICGRISne30x8
  test and C96 tests)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1153 (Fire btran2 is only computed for exposed
  veg patches, but is used over all veg patches)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1170 (CNFire code: btran2 should not be skipped
  when it's greater than 1)
- Partially addresses ESCOMP/CTSM#1142 (Add ctsm_sci test list that
  would be used for releases and making sure important resolutions run
  well)

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, for all CN/BGC configurations

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All CN/BGC configurations
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      larger than roundoff; expected to be same climate, but not
      investigated yet


  To verify that the answer changes only came from expected changes, I
  did a few rounds of testing. The following numbers refer to the groups
  of changes listed under "Purpose of changes", above. The changes in
  groups (4) and (5) were combined with those in groups (1) and (3) -
  i.e., the basically non-answer-changing sets.

  First, I tested with just the changes in (1). This led to differences
  in only limited configurations, as noted in
  https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1155#issuecomment-695035048:
  - nofire tests had diffs in BTRAN2
  - dynroots tests had extensive diffs because now btran2 is calculated
    after the dyn roots updates in each time step
  - tests where the compared clm2 h0 file includes the 0th time step had
    diffs just in BTRAN2, for reasons I couldn't determine

  Then I tested with the changes in (2), which were expected to change
  answers for all CN/BGC tests. In particular, these change answers due
  to:
  - using updated h2osoi_vol rather than the one earlier in the time
    step when calculating btran2
  - only considering points in the exposed veg filter when averaging
    btran2 from patch to column, rather than using stale values from
    no-longer-exposed patches (which also means having fire_m = 0 if
    there are no currently-exposed veg patches in a column) (fix for
    ESCOMP/CTSM#1153)
  - treating btran2 values that are slightly greater than 1 as 1, rather
    than ignoring them completely (fix for ESCOMP/CTSM#1170)

  Finally, I tested with all of the changes, comparing against the
  baselines generated from (2). As expected, the only answer changes in
  this final round were in the BTRAN2 diagnostic field (due to setting
  btran2 to 0 over non-exposed-veg points).

One-line Summary: Improve robustness of onset and offset counters when changing dt

Purpose of changes
------------------

The logic in CNPhenology for onset_counter and offset_counter was not
robust when the model time step differed from the time step used to
generate the finidat file. This showed up when running with a 20-minute
time step using a finidat file that was generated with a 30-minute time
step. See https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1163 for details.

The fix here improves the situation significantly, but I believe still
leaves some issues remaining; see
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1167 for details.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1163 (onset_counter variable on (all?) restart
  files is not compatible with subsequent model runs using a 20 minute
  time step)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
- ESCOMP/CTSM#1167 (Rework CNPhenology onset and offset triggers to be
  more robust to changes in dt)
  - This issue was not exactly introduced in this tag, but it captures
    some things that I think still need to be done for complete robustness

One-line Summary: Add capability for dynamic lakes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Adds the capability for dynamic lake areas, read from the
landuse_timeseries file. This represents reservoir construction. For
now, this capability is off by default. Turning it on requires new
fields on the landuse_timeseries file which cannot yet be produced by
mksurfdata_map; these new fields will be added in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073.

A substantial part of this tag involved changing the accounting of water
and energy in lakes in order to conserve water and energy across
landunit transitions while not producing too large adjustment
fluxes. This change results in roundoff-level answer changes for all
transient cases.

The core changes in this tag are from Inne Vanderkelen, in consultation
with Bill Sacks. Additional changes are from Bill Sacks, in consultation
with Inne Vanderkelen.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Using the dynamic lakes functionality will require either the
  mksurfdata_map changes in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073 or
  manually adding the necessary fields to the landuse_timeseries file.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Using the dynamic lakes functionality will require either the
  mksurfdata_map changes in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073 or
  manually adding the necessary fields to the landuse_timeseries file.
- For this reason, the new test
  (ERS_Lm25.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHistClm50BgcCropQianRsGs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly)
  requires a manual step to create the necessary landuse_timeseries
  file. This step is documented in the README file for the
  clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly testmod.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a single-point test covering dynamic lakes, using a

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):
  And always remove these three lines and parts that don't apply.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Transient cases
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      Mostly roundoff-level. See below for details.

      - Differences in HEAT_CONTENT1, ICE_CONTENT1, LIQUID_CONTENT1, as
        expected

      - In transient tests (including Hist/SSP, Fates, CNDV and
        transient glacier), roundoff-level diffs in EFLX_DYNBAL,
        QFLX_ICE_DYNBAL and QFLX_LIQ_DYNBAL, along with related flux
        terms, and river volume

      - In some transient tests, roundoff-level diffs in methane terms,
        presumably from downstream effects of changes in VOLR due to
        roundoff-level changes in fluxes. In multi-year tests, these
        methane diffs grow to bigger than roundoff-level, but I think
        they originate from roundoff-level diffs. (I feel like I've seen
        this high sensitivity before.)

      - glcMEC_increase test
        (ERP_P180x2_D_Ld5.f19_g17_gl4.I1850Clm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-glcMEC_increase)
        shows significant differences in river-related terms, maybe due
        to glacier running over lake and now lake has different states
        than before; also, FILLDIFFs in h1 file because lake remains
        active even when it goes to 0 area.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?
   - Examined cprnc RMS diffs

Detailed list of changes
------------------------

 Changes were implemented in three steps:

 1) Bit-for-bit: @billsacks simplified subroutine QSat by making three
 arguments optional (es, qsdT, esdT).

 2) Answer-changing: @slevisconsulting replaced local calculations of
 qsat in /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc with calls to
 CTSM's subroutine QSat. Subroutine QSat uses a higher-order polynomial
 approximation to estimate qsat, which explains the larger than
 round-off diffs. When moving the three identical local approximations
 to QSat as a temporary test instead of using the higher-order
 polynomial approximation, the diffs reduce to round-off.

 3) Bit-for-bit: @slevisconsulting consolidated repeating codes in
 /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc by placing in the new
 file /src/utils/lnd_import_export_utils.F90.

One-line Summary: Start the clm5_1 physics series, with some changes to the fire model from Fang Li

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fang Li's latest Fire version - includes allowing clm5.1 phys version. New physics option is added
called "clm5_1", with currently the new feature to use the latest fire changes. This has some
adjustments to the fire model and includes some changes to the parameter file. Other new features
will be added into clm5_1 in future tags.

Also bring in mksurfdata changes for the raw urban dataset change. This adds some changes to
mksurfdata for a new urban raw dataset, as well as preparation for new changes for some other
urban changes that will be a future part of clm5_1. Also use the half degree lightning dataset
by default for clm5_1.

Start adding a new test list ctsm_sci that tests all the scientifically supported compsets.
Some of those tests fail due to existing issues, that will be fixed later.

Some more work done to change clm to ctsm, and allow for ctsm as a component.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
  Fix #1142 -- Add ctsm_sci test list
  Fix #1145 -- File was corrupted on glade
  Fix #1144 -- Move btran2 to just inside of fire model
  Fix #889 --- Some adjustments to the Li Fire model

Significant changes to scientifically-supported configurations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Does this tag change answers significantly for any of the following physics configurations?
(Details of any changes will be given in the "Answer changes" section below.)

    [Put an [X] in the box for any configuration with significant answer changes.]

[ ] clm5_0

[ ] ctsm5_0-nwp

[ ] clm4_5

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): None

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): Adds clm5_1 option to CLM_PHYSICS_VERSION
  clm5_1_GSWP3v1 is the only LND_TUNING_MDOE option for clm5_1
  New compsets added for CLM51 I2000Clm51BgcCropGs, I2000Clm51BgcGs, I1850Clm51BgcGs, IHistClm51BgcGs, IHistClm51BgcCropGs


Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): clm5_1 physics options added in
    Add the ability to set the component name in filenames (default is still clm2, but can be clm4, olr clm5)
     By default lightning dataset for clm5_1 is the half degree file

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): All params files updated with new fields for fire

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing: Add ctsm_sci test list and move some clm5_0 to clm5_1 and one one clm5_1 specific test

Code reviewed by: self


CTSM testing: regular, tools

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - PASS (853 tests are different)

  tools-tests (test/tools):

    cheyenne - PASS

  python testing (see instructions in python/README.md; document testing done):

    cheyenne -- PASS

  regular tests (aux_clm):

    cheyenne ---- OK
    izumi ------- PASS

If the tag used for baseline comparisons was NOT the previous tag, note that here:


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: No (although clm5_1 is a new physics option that is different)
