One-line Summary: Fix auto-detection of CIME_MODEL in a standalone checkout

Purpose of changes
------------------

The auto-detection of whether CIME_MODEL is acme or cesm is broken in
standalone checkouts of clm4_5_18_r273. (This auto-detection relied on
whether there was an SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES file present at the top
level.)

This tag points to a new cime version that fixes this issue.

One-line Summary: Support a standalone checkout from git

Purpose of changes
------------------

This PR allows a standalone git-based checkout to work. Starting with
this tag, we'll be using git rather than svn for CLM/CTSM development.

The biggest changes here are pulling in manage_externals, which serves
the role of svn externals. After cloning the repository, you can get all
of the necessary externals by running:

./manage_externals/checkout_externals

See the file README_EXTERNALS.rst at the top level of the repository for
more details on using this tool.

Other than that, this PR mostly involves changes to allow you to run
from the new directory structure of a standalone checkout: Now all of
the CLM/CTSM directories appear at the top level of the checkout, rather
than nested under components/clm.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):

- https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/220 For new standalone
  organization, need to generalize paths for tools and testing


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

- The svn trunk is now frozen. All future development will occur in the
  master branch of https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm

- A standalone git checkout will have all CLM directories (src, bld,
  etc.) at the top level, rather than under components/clm.

- To get all externals after cloning the git repository, run
  ./manage_externals/checkout_externals

  See the file README_EXTERNALS.rst at the top level of the repository
  for more details on using this tool.

- More details on working with the git repository will be coming soon

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

One-line Summary: Bring in latest FATES release version to CLM trunk: fates_s1.4.1_a3.0.0_rev2

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bring in the latest version of FATES from NGEET/fates-release and the associated interface
changes in CLM from NGEET/fates-clm. The new version is 1.4.1 for science and version 3.0 of
the API updated from 1.3.0 for science and 1.0.0 for the API.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CCTSM Issue #): #219
  #219 -- Options listed incorrectly in testlist_clm.xml

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID): (or found)
  #216 -- PE layout for hcru_hcru needs to be increased so that it can run
  #213 -- CPLHIST case is matching the wrong CLM_NML_USE_CASE
  #212 -- Can't use a non-fates restart file to interpolate to a simulation with fates
  #211 -- Can't handle interpolating from a fates restart file because of the cohort dimension

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): Simple FATES initial-condition
   files were added for present day at f45 and 1x1_brazil. FATES IC can't be interpolated from
   so you either have to have an exact match or do a cold start.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): New FATES namelist items:
   use_fates_planthydro, use_fates_ed_st3, use_fates_ed_prescribed_phys, 
   use_fates_inventory_init, fates_inventory_ctrl_filename,use_fates_logging

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): when FATES on, non-fates finidat
   files won't be matched

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): New fates param file
    and finidat files for f45 and 1x1_brazil

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing: ed test list removed and updated fates list added in
   with new version=2.0 format, fates test list now sets machine/compiler rather than
   using generic "fates" for both.

One-line Summary: Update testlist to v2 and remove yellowstone

Purpose of changes
------------------

Redo the testlist in version 2 format and remove yellowstone from it. Also update mosart and rtm with updated
test lists. The new testlist format also allows wallclock times to be set (and they are) so that they can run 
in the queue faster. Change some files that referenced bugzilla ID's to github issue #'s. Update tools testing 
for gen_domain to use version under cime/tools rather than the copy under clm.

One-line Summary: Always use multiple elevation classes for glacier, even with stub glc

Purpose of changes
------------------

Up until now, we have been using the glacier_mec (multiple elevation
class) scheme when running with CISM, but the old non-elevation class
scheme when running with a stub glacier model (SGLC). This is
problematic because it means that simply switching from CISM to SGLC
fundamentally changes CLM's glacier physics. (Note: with the current
configuration, the multiple elevation class scheme is enabled over
Greenland and Antarctica but not elsewhere.)

There are a few use cases where this is important:

- Single-point and regional runs over glacier regions: In this case, you
  cannot use CISM. Members of the LIWG want to do runs like this so they
  can do single-point testing with the multiple elevation class scheme.

- Currently, CISM does not support a Gregorian calendar (i.e., with leap
  years). So cases with a Gregorian calendar need to use SGLC. This
  includes data assimilation and CAM specified dynamics runs. We want
  the physics of these runs to match the standard CLM physics as closely
  as is feasible.

- There may be other cases where a user doesn't want to include CISM
  because of the extra complexity this involves, such as when setting up
  a new grid (which would require additional mapping files for
  CISM). Again, we want the physics of these runs to match the standard
  CLM physics as closely as is feasible.

Note that runs with SGLC will still differ somewhat from runs with CISM,
even when CISM is running in the typical NOEVOLVE mode. This is because
there will be differences in % glacier and topographic heights over
Greenland: in a run with CISM, this information comes from CISM at the
start of the run so that CLM and CISM agree in this respect; in a run
with SGLC this information comes from CLM's surface dataset.

However: Running with SGLC now gives the same answers as running with
CISM with GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING set to FALSE. (These both differ from the
standard configuration that uses CISM with GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING TRUE
just over Greenland.)

Mostly-unrelated change: Remove tropicAtl grid


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
- https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/158 now causes test failures for
  ERS_Lm20_Mmpi-serial.1x1_smallvilleIA.I2000Clm50BgcCropGs.yellowstone_pgi.clm-monthly,
  since we're now using a new and buggy surface dataset for that case.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- If you use an finidat file from an old run that used SGLC, you'll need
  to run init_interp and will need to set
  init_interp_fill_missing_with_natveg = .true. in user_nl_clm. Note
  that this will initialize glacier_mec landunits with information from
  vegetated landunits, which is not a very good initialization, so
  you'll want to spin up for a while to spin up the new glacier_mec
  landunits.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): no

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): no

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
- New surface datasets for single-point and regional runs: These now
  have the data necessary to run with the multiple elevation class
  glacier scheme. None of our out-of-the-box single-point or regional
  datasets have any glacier cover, so this doesn't lead to substantive
  changes. Note, though, that the smallville datasets hadn't been
  updated in a while, so there are bigger changes to the smallville
  datasets. The new smallville datasets are buggy (due to
  https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/158), but the old ones wouldn't
  have worked with the new code due to missing glacier_mec
  information. Note that I have NOT changed the landuse.timeseries
  files, because those don't change in any substantive way with the
  setting of -glc_nec in mksurfdata_map.

- Runs with SGLC now point to different finidat files by default: they
  now point to finidat files that were generated with glacier_mec, which
  may differ substantially from the files that were generated without
  glacier_mec (since I think these came from completely different
  spinups).

Substantial timing or memory changes: Expect some performance
degradation in SGLC runs, since now we're using multiple elevation
classes over Greenland and Antarctica, though I haven't investigated it
carefully.

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing: Delete tropicAtl_subset tests: these tests
didn't provide much value, and the code they cover is also covered by
unit tests

Code reviewed by: self

Did you follow the steps in .CLMTrunkChecklist: yes

CLM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - ok

    prove test_build_namelist fails as on trunk

    main build-namelist tests pass, clm4_5 and clm5_0 lnd_in files
    differ from trunk as expected

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    cheyenne - pass

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    and is described in detail below.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_18_r269


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All compsets with SGLC (as opposed to CISM)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Potentially new climate, though not investigated carefully

      Answers change in runs with SGLC due to the use of different
      out-of-the-box finidat files: they now point to finidat files that
      were generated with glacier_mec, which may differ substantially
      from the files that were generated without glacier_mec (since I
      think these came from completely different spinups).

      For global runs, even without finidat differences, answers change
      over Greenland and Antarctica, since we're now using the
      multiple-elevation-class scheme there. Answers are the same
      outside of Greenland and Antarctica, where we still use a single
      glacier elevation class. (Based on spot-checking FSH in a 3-year
      cold start run.)

      (For single-point and regional runs, differences are mainly just
      due to changes in finidat. One exception may be smallville tests,
      since the smallville surface datasets have changed more
      extensively; I did not investigate the smallville answer changes
      carefully.)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

========= These glacierMEC use cases weren't accomplishing anything:

One-line Summary: Move externals to version in github

Purpose of changes
------------------

Move the CLM externals to the version in github for MOSART, RTM and
PTCLM. For PTCLM this meant updating to a version that didn't take
advantage of subversion keywords. I also updated to a version that
can properly compare to the files it keeps even with differences
of user, machine, path, or date.

One-line Summary: Fix calculation of stomatal resistence used in dry-deposition, increase threshold of totvegc for soil decomposition to 0.1

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes from Louisa Emmons to fix the calculation of stomatal resistence in the dry-deposition code so it's the inverse
of the previous calculation (and the arbitrary multiplicitive factor to reduce it was removed). Add new optional history
fields for dry-deposition.

Increase the threshold of total vegetation carbon for when decomposition pools are reset from 1.e-8 to 0.1. This change comes from
Dave Lawrence and Keith Oleson. The code was also modified to use better names for this rather than ccrit and ncrit which came in
clm4_5_17_r264. Add some new checking for these settings at initialization. Add some changes to the default CMIP6 output from
Keith Oleson.

Add in f05 fsurdat and one landuse.timeseries datasets. Add check in SSP test that makes sure the compset used includes MOSART as
expected.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 2545, 2546
   2526 -- Fix calculation of stomatal resistance for dry deposition
   2545 -- SSP test assumes that MOSART is being used, and dies inexplicably if not

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   Add new optional history fields when drydeposition is on:  DRYDEPV_*, RS_DRYDEP_O3

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files) Add f05 fsurdat and one landuse.timeseries file:

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
    RS_DRYDEP_O3 history field is hardcoded for Ozone. In most cases the same value would apply to other species, but it is
    hardcoded to give values for Ozone.

One-line Summary: Fixes to accumulator fields

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Only accumulate accumulators over active (typically,
    non-zero-weight) patches/columns. This changes answers for transient
    runs. Previously, accumulator fields were being accumulated even
    when a patch/column was inactive. In many cases this was relatively
    harmless, but in some cases it was accumulating garbage like
    spval. Then, once the point became active, it could take a while for
    the garbage accumulated values to be worked out.

    This changes answers for transient runs. I have examined all
    accumulator fields used in a typical BgcCrop run (this does NOT
    include fields that are only used for CNDV or FATES). Most changes
    only last for the first month or so that a point is active, but
    there are larger changes for:

    - PREC10 and PREC60: The changes in these are probably the most
      extreme. In the old code, these started as spval (rather than a
      blank slate) over newly-active patches. PREC10 is garbage for the
      first few years after a point becomes active. I didn't look at
      PREC60, but its logic is the same as PREC10, so I would expect it
      to be garbage for about the first 20 years after a point becomes
      active. PREC10 is used in the fire code and for stress deciduous
      phenology. PREC60 is used in the fire code.

    - AnnET: In the old code, this started as 0 (rather than a blank
      slate) over newly-active points. This affects answers for the
      first year or two. This is used in N fixation code.

    - FSUN24 and FSUN240: In the old code, these started out as spval;
      it takes a few years for the FSUN240 accumulator to come back down
      to reasonable values (even though it's a 10-day accumulator, its
      "exponential running average" behavior means that it takes much
      longer for memory of a huge value like spval to disappear). These
      are just used in VOCEmissionsMod.

    I have not investigated how much these changes in accumulators
    affect the science of the model. The biggest effects will probably
    be in the fire code in transient runs, but I haven't looked at how
    big of an effect these errors in PREC60 have.

    There are also potentially very large changes in CNDV, due to change
    in behavior of some patch-level accumulators which are needed for
    PFT establishment (and thus should be available over inactive
    patches, but no longer are valid for inactive patches). However,
    these fields were already buggy (see bug 2537).

(2) For startup/hybrid runs with non-blank finidat (including runs with
    use_init_interp): Continue accumulating continuously from where
    things were in the finidat file. Previously, many of the
    accumulators were being reset in startup/hybrid runs. This appeared
    to be an accident of the implementation details, whose fix was easy
    as a side-effect of the fix for (1). This shouldn't have a huge
    effect: most accumulators are order 10 days, with the longest being
    365 days, so differences should work themselves out within the first
    year or so. But this could be important if you expect a spinup run
    to transition continuously into a transient run (for example).

    This changes answers for any startup or hybrid case with non-blank
    finidat, where the restart file is from this tag or later. It does
    NOT change answers for old restart files. (These old files are
    missing the new _NSTEPS fields associated with each accumulator
    field, and so nsteps values are set to 0 in a startup/hybrid run,
    similarly to the old behavior.)

Also, a somewhat-unrelated change: Abort if a field is missing from the
restart file in a branch run (just as we do for a continue run); tell
the user to do a startup or hybrid run in this case. My reason for
folding this change into this tag was so that I don't need to worry
about backwards compatibility of branch runs with old restart files.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 2526: Some CLM accumulated fields (via accumulMod) are incorrect with dynamic landunits

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
- The following pre-existing bugs may be somewhat worse now:
  - 2537: Climate accumulator fields incorrect for CNDV
  - 2539: CNDV logic for agdd20 and tmomin20 needs to be revised to
          account for when a given patch/column becomes active

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

- Can no longer do a branch run if some fields are missing from the
  restart file, either due to code changes or configuration changes (need
  to do hybrid or startup).

- Cannot do a branch from restart files generated with prior tags,
  because the _NSTEPS restart fields associated with accumulation fields
  are missing.

- Startup or hybrid runs using restart files that were generated from
  prior tags will not take advantage of fix (2) above.

One-line Summary: Avoid negative snow densities

Purpose of changes
------------------

For very low temperatures, fresh snow densities were negative. This was
only happening at extremely low temperatures (below -100 deg C), but
caused snow balance errors when it occurred.

In exploring the LoTmpDnsSlater2017 parameterization in
NewSnowBulkDensity, I came away with the following thoughts:

   It seems like there should be a limit on the temperature-dependent
   bifall value. I extracted this function into python and played with
   it for a few minutes:

          else if (new_snow_density == LoTmpDnsSlater2017) then 
             ! Andrew Slater: A temp of about -15C gives the nicest
             ! "blower" powder, but as you get colder the flake size decreases so
             ! density goes up. e.g. the smaller snow crystals from the Arctic and Antarctic
             ! winters
             bifall(c) = -(50._r8/15._r8 + 0.0333_r8*15_r8)*(forc_t(c)-tfrz) - 0.0333_r8*(forc_t(c)-tfrz)**2
          end if

   It looks like the intention is to have snow densities that increase
   with decreasing temperature (below -15 C), but the effect of this
   parabolic function is to have densities start coming back down as
   temperature decreases too low (below about -58 C). My sense is that
   we should do one of the following in the above block of code:

   (1) Limit bifall(c) to be no less than 50... my read of this code is
   that temperature-dependent bifall is never meant to go below 50.

   (2) For this cold-temperature-based bifall, use an "effective" forc_t
   that is never colder than about -58 C – or the point at which this
   function begins to decrease with further-decreasing temperatures. (We
   could determine the exact temperature at which this function turns
   over... -58 C is just an approximation.) I'm not positive that this
   is what's intended, but my read of the comment suggests that
   densities were never intended to start decreasing with
   further-cooling temperatures.

See comments and figures in
http://bugs.cgd.ucar.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=2536 for more details.

Leo van Kampenhout and Jan Lenaerts support limitation option 2, which
is my preference as well. Thus, this tag implements that limitation.

This change changes answers for (downscaled) atmospheric forcing
temperatures below -57.55 deg C. These very low temperatures are rare,
but they do sometimes occur, both in coupled runs and in offline runs.

      Many (but not all) tests show answer changes. Answers should only
      change for (downscaled) forcing temperatures below -57.55 deg C. I
      spot-checked one test with answer changes
      (SMS_D_Ld3.f10_f10_musgs.I1850Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-default). I
      checked H2OSNO and FSH in this test, in the last day's h0 file;
      these fields differ (relative to the baseline) in only one
      gridcell. TBOT was about -55 deg C in the daily average of the
      last day, so it seems reasonable that this forcing temperature was
      below -57.55 deg C at some point in the 3-day simulation.

One-line Summary: Update the clm50 parameter file for better behavior with prognostic crop, and fix a bug in clm50 urban model

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update a few parameters to tweak prognostic crop harvest yields, adjusting FUN costs, and changing C4 crops and 
wheat by Keith Oleson, Dave Lawrence, and Danica Lombardozzi. Danica had this to say: 
  Overall, the wheat parameters work well (give us correct Fertilized - Unfertilized behavior 
  and reasonable crop yields), but the C4 crop parameters are less satisfying. The 2A parameter 
  changes still have trouble with the fertilized - unfertilized behavior in some regions and 
  lower yields, but seems to be the best combined set of behaviors since there seems to be 
  a direct tradeoff between the fertilized behavior and crop yields

Also a fix to urban initialization of rootfr for pervious road. It had used a magic number to assuming nlevsoi
was 10. Now we divide by the actual nlevsoi.

One-line Summary: Changes from Dave Lawrenece on resetting soil carbon for spinup

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes from Dave Lawrence so that total vegetation carbon (totvegc) is used for resetting soil carbon
stocks during the AD spinup exit (to determine if you should reset both carbon and nitrogen). Also read 
in totvegc for C13, and C14. These are then passed down into soilbiogechemistry nitrogenstate and carbonstate
restart to determine if the decomposition pools should be reset. The resetting is only done over non-crop
vegetation (ignoring both prognostic and generic crop types) and is only done on the exit_spinup phase
going out of accellerated decomposition mode.

Fix a couple small issues that in principle could change answers, but we didn't see answer changes in testing.
There was an error in how rootfr was initialized if it wasn't on the restart file. Made sure the crop patch
level restart variables are read after the enter_spinup code.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------
  2406 -- Crop patch-level restart variables read after enter_spinup code

One-line Summary: Drydep vel. for SO2 doubled, influence of organic mater in soil calmed, max daylength not hardwired to present day

Purpose of changes
------------------

Keep the hydraulic conductivity for organic soil higher than it is for mineral soil. This was found to be an issue and fixed by 
Sean Swenson, Dave Lawrence, and Keith Oleson. Double dry deposition velocity for SO2 (Jean-Francois Lamaruque) for both clm4_5
and clm5_0.  Fix bug for value of NACTIVE at first time-step. Partial fix so that max daylengh isn't hardwired to present day at least
at initialization (see caveat below). Move the sample files for the mkprocdata_map tool (for mapping between unstructured grids
and regular lat lon grids) out of CLM and into $CSMDATA. Update the c13/c14 timeseries files to the 2.0 version as per Keith Lindsay.

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  Max daylength will still be wrong in cases where variable_years is used, where the orbit
  changes after initializaiton. It'll start out correct and begin to diverge each year.
  Since, this feature is untested it's not worth going through the additional changes to
  correct it during the run.

    version is now the default. Non-downscaled history fields are now
    noted explicitly with a "_FROM_ATM" suffix. A detailed list of
    changes is given below.

(2) Properly turn on VIC for CLM45 compsets (fixes bug 2465)

(3) Use correct PE layouts for CISM1

(4) Remove CWDC_HR diagnostic field, which was always 0 (fixes bug 2502)

One-line Summary: Add option to reset snow over glacier columns

Purpose of changes
------------------

We have had an option to reset snow over non-glacier columns, using the
reset_snow namelist variable. This is useful when transitioning from a
spinup with one set of atmospheric forcings to a run with substantially
different atmospheric forcings. We originally did not provide an option
to reset snow over glacier columns, because we couldn't find a
satisfactory way to determine which glacier columns should and should
not be reset. However, members of the LIWG have found that it's hard to
analyze some test runs without this option.

This tag, therefore, provides an option to reset snow over glacier
columns, using a new namelist flag reset_snow_glc. You can optionally
provide an elevation threshold for this resetting: By setting
reset_snow_glc_ela to some elevation (in meters), only glacier columns
below this elevation get their snow packs reset. Note that you run the
risk of baking in answers with this (how much of the resulting spatial
patterns are due to your choice of where to reset snow?), but this can
still be useful in some cases. In general, this is meant for testing,
and not for "real" scientific production runs.

Original changes were from Leo van Kampenhout, with some refactoring by
Bill Sacks.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
- 2525: test_build_namelist.pl fails in clm4_5_16_r260
  (this bug existed prior to this tag, but was first discovered here)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variables:
  - reset_snow_glc: logical; if set to .true., resets the snow pack over
    glacier columns
  - reset_snow_glc_ela: elevation threshold for resetting snow pack over
    glacier columns

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:
- reseedresetsnow testmod turns on snow resetting over glacier points,
  and so changes answers. It uses the reset_snow_glc_ela threshold that
  Leo has been using.

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - ok (run on yellowstone)
    Tests in build-namelist_test.pl pass but change answers as expected
    due to new namelist options.

    NOTE: prove test_build_namelist.pl fails (see bug 2525)

    cheyenne_intel ---- ok
    cheyenne_gnu ------ ok
    hobart_nag -------- ok
    hobart_pgi -------- ok
    hobart_intel ------ ok

    ok means tests pass, NLCOMP failures as expected. Also, expected
    baseline failure:
    ERS_D.f19_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-reseedresetsnow

    However, there were also baseline failures in these tests, due to
    problems with r260:

    (1)

    SMS_Ld5.f19_g17.IHistClm50Bgc.cheyenne_intel.clm-decStart
    SMS_Ld5.f19_g17.IHistClm50Bgc.yellowstone_pgi.clm-decStart
    SMS_Ld5.f19_g17.IHistClm50Bgc.yellowstone_intel.clm-decStart

    These are due to problems with the baseline, in terms of which cism
    history files are present. Baseline comparisons failed in the same
    way when using out-of-the-box r260. The current code seems correct
    in this respect, so this is just a problem with the baseline
    directories.

    (2)

    SMS_D_Ly2.1x1_brazil.IHistClm50BgcQianGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-ciso_bombspike1963

    Differences in C14 history fields. Baseline comparisons failed in
    the same way when using out-of-the-box r260. I can't tell if the
    baselines are correct or the trunk code is correct. I have asked
    Erik to look into this.

One-line Summary: Update paramater file for CLM50 as well as fates, fix a few issues

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update the parameter file for CLM5.0, changing: ekc_active,ekn_active,kn_nonmyc,psi50, and stem_leaf. Dave Lawrence,
Keith Oleson, Will Wieder, and Rosie Fischer were involved in changing these parameters to increase survivability of 
BDT Tropical and NDT Boreal and to slightly decrease the over-productivity of BDS boreal.

The version of FATES used was updated to one with the same API, but updated science (science_1.3.0 api_1.0.0).

There were a couple issues fixed as well. PTCLM was updated to fix a few issues and also allow us to test running
with an updated PTCLM user-mods-directory. So the US-UMB testing was updated to point to a freshly created directory.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
   2524 -- Run with decStart tests
   2523 -- Run with cnonly

    -crop option becomes a toggle for CLM_BLDNML_OPTS (so -no-crop is valid as well)
    Same setup for mksurfdata.pl was introduced as well (and for PTCLMmkdata)

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): None

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): New parameter file for CLM5.0

One-line Summary: Update to latest cime from cesm2_0_beta07 and config_components version 3

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update CLM to use version 3 for config_components.xml which has additional error checking of compset names. Also
update it for mosart, cism and rtm. And cime is updated to the version used in cesm2_0_beta07. There are a few
new features brought in with the latest cime that are described below. CLM now requires one and only one modifier 
for what type it is in the compset name (i.e. only one "%" as in CLM45%BGC or CLM50%SP). Will now abort when
CLM build-namelist encounters a warning (after printing information on all warnings). To ignore the warnings
and continue add the new "-ignore_warnings" to CLM_BLDNML_OPTS. "-irrig" is now an option to CLM_BLDNML_OPTS
only for clm4_0, set "irrigate" namelist item in your user_nl_clm file for clm4_5 or clm5_0. By default build-namelist
sets irrigate to true for transient or present-day configurations if crop is on and clm5_0 (unless DV on). Get PTCLMmkdata fully
converted over to cheyenne, and create a new set of files for testing it's ability to create cases. Checking for
.true. or .false. in CLM build-namelist is now more robust and allows for "F" or "T" as newer FORTRAN versions do.


Fix several bugs as described below. PTCLM and CLM tools were both verified to work and pass testing.
The PE layout for f10 on hobart was changed to a single-node so that it would compare exactly to previous versions.
Fix a bug for NCK tests in RTM and MOSART. Get mksurfdata_map working correctly for f05. Error message when
you set finidat=' ' is more clear on what to do. You can also now do a cold-start for a hybrid case prints a warning),
but not allowed on a branch case.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 
  2519 -- Trouble setting use_aereoxid_prog=.false./
  2515 -- Setting finidat=' ' gives cryptic error message
  2510 -- Mapping files from the 1km grid can only be created on geyser
  2509 -- Bad mapping files for f05 resolution

  2494 -- MOSART test NLCOMP fails due to duplicate mosart_inparam in user_nl_mosart
  2477 -- Multiinstance mosart with REFCASE does not initialize

Notes of particular relevance for users

    CLM now allows one and only one modifier for the type of configuration in the compset name 
    (i.e. CLM50%BGC or CLM45%SP (only one "%" modifier is allowed) ). "-irrig" is now only allowed as an option
    to CLM_BLDNML_OPTS for clm4_0, for clm4_5/clm5_0 the handling of irrigate is handled inside CLM build-namelist.
    Remove some no longer needed forcing definitions for compsets (the year range at the beginning of the compset name).
    Now abort on build-namelist warnings (but adding "-ignore_warnings" option to CLM_BLDNML_OPTS allow it to run without it).
    Remove compset forcings that aren't being used: 5505, C2R6, C2R8, C2R4, C1, GEOS (start of long compset names)

Changes to CIME user interface:
- Eleminate --user-compset. Clean up caseroot directory upon failed creation. 
- Check coupler fields for nan.
- New xml variable, readmode, 
- xmlquery --group has been changed go xmlquery --get-group
- New case.qstatus tool.
- Autodeletion of broken case dirs.
- Add --mail-user and --mail-type to case.submit.
- Remove --user-compset from create_newcase, allow compset longname in testname argument to create_test.
- New argument to create_clone (--user-mods-dir to also point to user-mods directory that will be used)

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
    Correct SCRIP grid file for f05 and add mapping files for them

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): None

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): None

Changes to tests or testing:
  clm-decStarts cism history is a bit different (shown as changing answers)
  Allow longname in tests
- Add --pesfile option to create_test.
- New --timeout flag for wait_for_tests
- CLM now needs to define its own LII and SSP tests (they already were put in place, now it's actually using them)

One-line Summary: Revert change to fire, set n_melt_glcmec=10, update mosart to version that doesn't accumulate water in short rivers

Purpose of changes
------------------

Revert the changes to fire that came in clm4_5_16_r257. Add some notes that clarify that the code as is, is correct.
Set n_melt_glcmec=10.0 for clm5.0 (This should have happened in the fresh snow grain size change in clm4_5_16_r256).
Update mosart to a version that doesn't accumulate water in short rivers. This is done by explicitly making sure river length
isn't smaller than a minimum value.

One-line Summary: Fix two bugs found by Hui Tang, one for Carbon isotopes and one in the fire model

Purpose of changes
------------------

This is a fix for two bugs found by Hui Tang. One is for Carbon isotopes where a fix that came in for
clm4_5_11_r188, used leafc for too many of the isotope flux calculation calls. This changes it so the
correct terms are used for the particular flux.

The other fix is in the fire model where fire emissions were using the wrong fire related
mortality term for dead stem and should have been using a different type. Now it matches the
flux type, as well as the term used in combustion completness for the particular fire emission.

Bugs fixed or introduced

One-line Summary: Fresh snow grain radius is temperature dependent

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes from Leo VanKampenhout to have fresh snow grain size a function of air temperature for CLM50.
Behavior is the same as before for CLM45 with fresh snow grain size a fixed parameter.  For CLM50
it's that same value (54.526) less than -30C and linear with T up to 204.526 at 0C, and 204.526 for 
temperatures greater than 0C.

One-line Summary: Changes to crop and enabling Carbon isotopes for crop and some miscellaneous small changes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes for crop on as well as enabling carbon isotopes when crop is on. Fix some small answer changing issues. 
Also bring in new timeseries datasets for C14 as well as now C13. The C14 dataset has hardwired latitude sectors 
it uses (so previous file can NOT be used). Properly handle and update C13/C14 variables when crop is on.
Handle CIsoFluxCalc calls for a list of crop specific fields. Add cropseedc_deficit, to storvegc as well as totveg.
Send livestemc to litter for prognostic crop. Ignore downreg for carbon isotopes in Fractionation subroutine.
For dynamic roots, use rooting values on parameter dataset which is set to values from PFT=1.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 
  2508 -- Incorrect landuse.timeseries datasets for f09 and hcru for rcp=8.5 in r254
  2489 -- Set c/nnegcrit for clm45/clm50 (10X higher for clm45 than clm50)
  2412 -- Initialize rootfr to PFT==1 value for dynamic roots -- update params files
  2396 -- make subtraction the default behavior for clm4_5.
  2316 -- update carbon isotopes same as C12: CNVegCarbonStateType.F90
  2211 -- Fix time used for Ciso time series

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
  2511 -- Overflow with Carbon isotopes

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
   Change to restarts when c-isotopes on

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   New namelist items: use_c13_timeseries, atm_c13_filename
   New history vars:   C13_GRAINC, C13_CROPSEEDC_DEFICIT, C14_GRAINC, C14_CROPSEEDC_DEFICIT

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   Set cnegcrit/nnegcrit for CLM45/CLM50

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
   New C13 and C14 timeseries files
   New params files, but only answer changing part is for dynamic roots 
       (setup bare-soil on file to match what's used for PFT=1)
   Bring in correct datasets for rcp8.5 for f09 and hcru
   1x1_numaIA 1850 and 1850-2000 transient files

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   The C13/C14 timeseries should be implemented with streams for greater flexibility, robustness, and code
   reuse. The new C14 timeseries file is hardcoded for three specific latitude sectors, and thus can't use
   the previous file, nor a file of a different configuration. Downreg is passed down from get_downreg_patch 
   in clm_driver, to CanopyFluxes to Fractionation, but no longer used (it should be removed).
  
   Note the following from Dave: While debugging crop isotope code, found that cpool_patch and frootc_patch 
     could occasionally be very small but nonzero numbers after crop harvest, which persists 
     through to next planting and for reasons that could not 100% isolate, caused C12/C13 ratios to occasionally 
     go out of bounds. Zeroing out these small pools and putting them into the flux to the atmosphere solved many 
     of the crop isotope problems

Changes to tests or testing: Added some tests, two of the new tests fail due to bug 2511

M       components/clm/src/biogeochem/CNCStateUpdate1Mod.F90 ---- Change location of xsmrpool update. Dave added this note:
             While debugging crop isotope code, found that cpool_patch and frootc_patch 
             could occasionally be very small but nonzero numbers after crop harvest, which persists 
             through to next planting and for reasons that could not 100%
             isolate, caused C12/C13 ratios to occasionally go out of
             bounds. Zeroing out these small pools and putting them into the flux to the

One-line Summary: Update surface datasets, and point to new CMIP6 population density dataset

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update all surface datasets to new versions that have updated soil albedo, and use latest PFTCFT files. Also
get mksurdata_map fully working on cheyenne for batch mode. Point to latest CMIP6 population density dataset
for historical case, this is with HYDE3.2 data. New fsurdat files for 16pft are with irrigation on. If ask for
irrig=F and 16pft won't be able to find any files.

One-line Summary: Check on reasonable import/export from CLM, check ndep units from input file

Purpose of changes
------------------

Do some reasonable physical checks on the import/export state to/from CLM. Checking for NaN's and
that solar should be greater or equal to zero, LW down, specific humidity greater than zero.
Check the units on the input nitrogen deposition file and if per year divide by seconds per year,
leave alone if per seconds, and die if units aren't recognized. Increase the tolerence for warnings
for Nitrogen, Carbon, and soil energy balance. Add missing MPI broadcasts for two ndep namelist variables.
Fix an LII test that was failing. Change the PE layout for f4x5 grids for yellowstone and cheyenne.
Add -die_on_duplicate option to parse_cime.cs.status and have summary option add notes about expected fails.

One-line Summary: Update parameter file for some crop albedo issues, and fix a bug in urban albedo for nightime

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bring in a new CLM50 parameter file that updates a few fields for prognostic crop with affect on crop albedo
(rholnir,taulnir,taulvis,xl). Bring in changes to fix urban albedo for nighttime from Keith Oleson. Rather than set 
albedo's for the urban canyon all to 1.0, set them to the viewfactors, as that will result in combined albedo of
one, whereas the previous way ended up with albedo's greater than one.

Here's a description from Keith about the change in urban albedo. " For diffuse radiation, which is 
independent of solar zenith angle, the road albedos appear to be exactly equal to the road-sky view 
factor.  And the wall albedos are equal to the wall-sky view factor. So the albedos are the albedo 
of the surface (1.0) times the appropriate view factor.  This makes sense.  All incident radiation
entering the canyon should be reflected to the sky and the contribution of each surface is according 
to the view factor of each surface to the sky as determined by the height to width ratio.  The view 
factors of the two walls and the road to the sky sums to 1.0.  So setting the diffuse albedos to 
these values when the sun is below the horizon results in a scaled diffuse albedo of 1.0.  For direct 
radiation, it's more complicated because the solar zenith angle is involved when running the 
radiation model.  However, it seems reasonable to assume the same albedos for direct as for diffuse."

One-line Summary: Update finundation dataset, new fsurdat files with updated soil color 
                  and soil depth, update mosart areas, fix cheyenne_gnu

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update all fsurdat datasets with updated soil color and soil depth. Soil color as modified by Peter Lawrence.
Soil depth was modified to use a mask for soil depth>0 which makes the minimum soil depth 3cm (model still has
a minimum of 40cm). Also updated area's for the mosart routing file (the previous areas were off by up to about 1%).
the update to the area's will influence fluxes. Also fix a problem so that cheyenne_gnu will work (remove pure
attribute from two functions).

Also bring in the updated finundation inversion from Sean Swenson. This will change the methane output
significantly for CLM50BGC cases. The previous inversion file was incorrect and shouldn't be used! The new file is also
at a higher resolution 1-degree rather than 2-degree.

One-line Summary: All new compsets, reworked test lists, and related fixes

Purpose of changes
------------------

The changes here were a joint effort between Dave Lawrence, Ben Andre, Erik
Kluzek, Mariana Vertenstein and Bill Sacks

(1) All new compset aliases, with the following changes:

    (a) Most compset aliases are now for CLM5, with fewer CLM45 compsets and
        even fewer CLM40 compsets.

    (b) Compset aliases now use capitalization of only the first letter of each
        piece, to avoid the alphabet soup problem. For example,
        IHistClm50BgcCrop

    (c) Some other tweaks have been made to compset aliases, such as always
        listing the time period and Sp (satellite phenology) explicitly

    (d) Compsets use GSWP3 forcing unless the alias specifies otherwise

    (e) Compsets use CISM2%NOEVOLVE - and so use glc_mec in CLM - unless the
        alias has Gs (for GLC - stub)

    (f) An evolving ice sheet (CISM2%EVOLVE) is now denoted by having a final
        'G' in the compset alias
        
(2) Completely reworked test lists:

    (a) Use new aliases

    (b) Changed most tests to CLM5

    (c) Merged the aux_clm45 and aux_clm40 test categories into aux_clm

    (d) Removed the 'null' test category, which was used for SBN tests

    (e) Some minor additional tweaks to the aux_clm test list to ensure
        appropriate coverage and remove some redundant tests

    (f) For a few testmods directories, removed some settings that had nothing
        to do with those testmods (use_dynroot, use_hydrstress)

(3) Fixed VIC:

    (a) Previously, VIC compsets were not actually turning VIC on; now they are

    (b) Fixed namelist defaults for VIC with CLM50

(4) Updated RTM and MOSART externals: changed their test lists and fixed a
    MOSART bug

(5) Updated CISM external; this changes answers for CISM when ice evolution is
    turned off, due to changing the lnd -> glc mapping in this case

(6) Point to a CIME branch that fixes some bugs

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 2473: Change order of tests run with the LII test
- 2474: CLM50 CN compsets seem to be set up wrong
- 2480: vichydro option doesn't work with CLM50 as it needs bedrock off and
        lower_boundary_condition=3 (with aquifer layer)

CIME Issues fixed (include issue #): I think some issues are fixed here, but I'm
not sure which ones

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
- 2485: CLM's 'ed' testlist still has old-style compsets
- 2486: Failure in camdenNJ test in prebeta test list
- 2488: Floating overflow in SoilBiogeochemNitrifDenitrifMod.F90
        (newly-discovered, but presumably existed in previous tags)
- 2489: Clm45BgcCrop case dies due to negative leafn
        (newly-discovered, but presumably existed in previous tags)

---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- All new compset aliases

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- All new compset aliases

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

    Ran most testing on r85975; just ran relevant tests on latest revision with
    changed compset (changed IHistClm50BgcGs to IHistClm50BgcQianGs)

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: N/A


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All tests BFAIL due to new compset
  aliases. Because of this, I'm not completely sure of the answer changes, but I
  think they are:
        - Tests with CISM2%NOEVOLVE change answers in fields on the glc grid due
          to new CISM external
        - CLM50 tests with Vic change answers because now they're actually using VIC
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      New climate for tests that change answers
    
   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Melt most ice runoff

Purpose of changes
------------------

Up until now, excess snow in CLM (accumulated beyond the snow capping limit) has
been sent to the ocean as an ice runoff flux. However, this caused problems in
some regions, in that it cooled an already-cold ocean, leading to excessive sea
ice growth. Keith Lindsay, Marika Holland and others suggested changing CLM so
that it sends this flux as liquid rather than ice runoff - having the atmosphere
melt the ice rather than having the ocean do so. These changes are implemented
here.

This has now been tested in many fully-coupled simulations, and it indeed solves
the problem of excessive sea ice growth, without having any noticeable
detrimental effects on other aspects of the simulation.

Specifically, this affects ice runoff from (a) glacier_mec columns outside of
Greenland and Antarctica, and (b) all other column types (vegetated, etc.). We
still send ice runoff from Greenland and Antarctica to simulate the ice calving
flux that occurs in those regions. In addition, we still send an ice runoff flux
generated from dynamic landunit adjustments.

This new behavior is used by default in CLM50, but not in CLM45.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_16_r247


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All CLM50 cases
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      new climate

      This changes runoff terms (liquid and ice) and the sensible heat flux sent
      to the atmosphere. In addition, there are limited changes in some
      methane-related terms; this is presumably due to the dependence of
      finundated on TWS, and the fact that TWS changes due to the changes in
      these runoff terms.

      There are also diffs in x2r_Flrl_irrig for this test (and the similar
      yellowstone test):
      ERS_D_Ld10.T31_g37_gl4.IGHISTCLM50.cheyenne_intel.clm-glcMEC_decrease. It
      makes sense that there would be x2r irrig diffs due to diffs in volr, but
      I was surprised that this test had any irrigation. It turns out this is
      due to bug #2479.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: b.e20.B1850.f09_g17.pi_control.all.149

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: ???

   Note that the climate tests were done on an earlier, kludgey
   implementation. I have verified that the latest implementation is bit-for-bit
   with that earlier implementation via a 5-year run of compset
   1850_DATM%GSWP3_CLM50%BGC-CROP_SICE_SOCN_MOSART_CISM2%NOEVOLVE_SWAV at
   resolution f09_g16, producing annual-average cpl history files. (For the
   original, used
   https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branch_tags/melt_ice_runoff_orig_tags/melt_ice_runoff_orig_n01_clm4_5_16_r246.)
   There were differences in a few CLM diagnostic fields, as expected (because I
   have tweaked some diagnostic fields in the latest version), but the cpl
   avghist files were bit-for-bit.

One-line Summary: New GLACIER_REGION field with CISM domain split in two

Purpose of changes
------------------

In an upcoming tag, we'll need a separate GLACIER_REGION for the purpose of
determining where ice runoff should be melted: we do not want this melt to
happen over Greenland itself, but we do want it to happen in peripheral parts of
the CISM domain (and in particular, we want it to happen over the Canadian
archipelago, which is within the CISM domain, and thus was within the
"Greenland" GLACIER_REGION). (We still need a GLACIER_REGION that encompasses
areas outside Greenland itself in case ice extent grows a bit beyond the current
boundaries. So we truly need two separate GLACIER_REGIONs for (a) Greenland
itself, and (b) peripheral areas of the CISM domain.) This tag updates the
surface datasets and related fields to have this extra GLACIER_REGION.

In addition to updating the GLACIER_REGION raw data file, this also introduces a
new regridding method that is applied to GLACIER_REGION: this takes the maximum
value from any source point (NOT the dominant value). This is important for the
new GLACIER_REGION, where we want a destination (CLM) cell to be considered in
region 2 (Greenland itself) if ANY overlapping source points are in region
2. This means that the ordering of regions in the GLACIER_REGION raw data file
is important: preference will be given to higher-numbered regions.

Note that I just changed surface datasets that had time stamp 170428 or
later. This excluded some older single point datasets, for which the new glacier
region doesn't matter anyway:
- surfdata_0.125x0.125_simyr2000_c150114.nc
- surfdata_0.125x0.125_mp24_simyr2000_c150114.nc
- surfdata_1x1_smallvilleIA_78pfts_simyr2000_c160127.nc
- surfdata_1x1_smallvilleIA_78pfts_simyr1850_c160127.nc
- surfdata_1x1_tropicAtl_16pfts_simyr1850_c160127.nc (used in tropicAtl_subset testmod)


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- There are some additional subtleties now for setting up a run with different
  glacier domains (e.g., a paleoclimate run)

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):

Originator(s):  sacks (Bill Sacks)

One-line Summary: Update to latest cime

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is to update to the latest version of cime.

One of the changes in this cime version is that component-specific system tests
(e.g., LII, SSP) can now be defined in the component rather than in cime. So
this tag defines LII and SSP in CLM. In addition, this adds an LVG test (Land
Virtual Glaciers), which verifies that adding virtual glacier columns doesn't
change answers.

Another significant change in this cime version is that the lnd -> glc
downscaling (i.e., remapping) method has been changed to be bilinear with a
later conservation correction, rather than area-conservative. This leads to
smooth fields on the CISM grid.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New drv_in namelist variable 'glc_renormalize_smb' - controls whether to apply
  global corrections to the downscaled lnd -> glc smb for conservation

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:
- Moves LII and SSP test definitions into CLM
- Adds new test type, LVG
- Adds an LVG test

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: see below
    - what platforms/compilers: see below
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): see below

    (1) Changes answers for cases with CISM, due to new downscaling
        method. These changes show up only for long tests with CISM, and are
        potentially climate-changing:

    (2) Changes answers for hobart-pgi tests, due to new version of the pgi
        compiler on hobart. Magnitude of the change not investigated.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Only adjust glc_mec topographic heights if glc_do_dynglacier is true

Purpose of changes
------------------

Two changes in this tag:

(1) Only adjust glc_mec topographic heights if glc_do_dynglacier is true (this
    namelist variable is controlled by the GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING xml
    variable). Previously, CLM updated its glacier topographic heights even if
    this variable was false (so we were not updating areas from CISM). Bill
    Lipscomb and Jeremy Fyke agreed a while ago that we should change this. None
    of us could remember why we initially set it up to always update topographic
    heights, but we felt that it's more intuitive to avoid updating topographic
    heights if we're not updating glacier areas.

    Note that setting GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING=FALSE is *not* a common thing to do,
    so this change does not affect most cases. (The typical way of doing one-way
    coupling with CISM is to use CISM2%NOEVOLVE, which turns off ice evolution
    but keeps GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING=TRUE in order to update CLM's glacier areas
    and topographic heights at initialization.)

(2) Adds some user mods and testmods (currently unexercised) for cmip6

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Cases with GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING=FALSE
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      new climate

  This affects tests with glcMEC_changeFlags and glcMEC_spunup_1way testmods

  Also, NLCOMP failures for a few tests, I think explainable by the process Erik
  used to update some testmods to get LII tests passing:
    FAIL SMS_D_Ln1.f09_g17.ICLM45BGC.yellowstone_gnu.clm-defaultf09IC NLCOMP
    FAIL ERP.f19_g17_gl4.IG1850CLM45.cheyenne_intel.clm-glcMEC_spunup_1way NLCOMP

One-line Summary: Update cime and cism externals, changes answers for IG compsets, test g17 grids, fix a few issues, update mksurfdata_map

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update the cime version which includes some important updates.  Remove lt_archive, new script query_config 
to query compsets and grids etcetera. Force user to always use case.submit rather than allow them to submit 
to batch queue on their own. Some updates to handling of namelist items in user_nl_clm. All grids now contain 
a mask variable. Also fixes a couple glitches from the previous version, see bugs fixed below.

Update cism which changes answers (for cases running with CISM) as 4km grid was changed.

Fix some small issues with CLM. Fix interpolation issue with GSSUN and GSSHA, use shr_mpi needed for unit-testing, and
fix an issue with a use of MCT routines for clm40.

Several updates to mksurfdata_map, fixing problems, starting to get it working on cheyenne, and upgrading to latest
CMIP6 PFT datasets from Peter Lawrence.

-Update cime and cism.
-Unit tests moved to cime/scripts/fortran_unit_testing/.
-Include Jim Edward's configcompsetupdate changes here.
-Convert mosart half-degree file from NetCDF-4 to NetCDF-3.
-Change grids in test lists so that mask is added to grids that need it (i.e. f45_f45 becomes f45_f45_mg37).
-Add note about supported compset IGM1850GSWCLM50BGCCROP for f09_g17, f19_g17.
-Use grids back to g16 as g17 domain files aren't there.
-Get LII tests working.
-Rerun the list of tests that failed, see if works again because of a system issue.
-use old g16 mask for CLM40 tests.
-Add CMIP5/CMIP6 names to surfdata file creation.
-Bring in mksrfunreplu branch.
-New rawdata PFT datasets from Peter.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): None

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

  cime update brought in quite a few changes
- Add skip-preview-namelist to case.submit and case_run.
  - Renamed manage_case to query_config.
    - manage_case -> query_config
      --compset -> --compsets
      --machine -> --machines
      added 'all' option for --compsets
      added 'current' and to --machines
    - Remove all references to lt_archive which will not be supported in
      CESM2.0.
    - Add Support for '+=' in Namelists.
    - Add --component Option to preview_namelist.
    - Add Support of true and false in Namelist.
  - Force user to always go through case.submit.
    - Adds support for namelist entries of the form foo(3) = 'a'
    - esmf_logging (and therefore drv_in) are now optional
    - New run time XML variable: ESMF_LOGFILE_KIND
    - New --answer flag to create_newcase
  -Update so that all relevent grids contain a mask variable.
 - Add preview_run to case.run

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): Added mapping files for 0.25x0.25_MODIS

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): Just to datasets to create surface datasets

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
    - Use ESMF7 on yellowstone and cheyenne.
    - Big cs.status upgrade.
    - Add --input-dir argument to create_test

Changes to tests or testing:
   Change most gx1v6 masks to gx1v7
   Keep clm40 tests at gx1v6

One-line Summary: History output cleanup from Dave Lawrence

Purpose of changes
------------------

* Reduce default history output by setting numerous variables to
  default=inactive, limiting some 3d vars to active soil layers only.

* Update default history output for CLM5.

* Added diagnostic new output for DWT_WOOD_PRODUCTC_GAIN_PATCH,
  GS_MOL, lake_icefracsurf_col, h2osoi_liq_tot_col, h2osoi_ice_tot_col

* Remove double accounting for CNSoy fixation when FUN is on.

* Bug fixes to allow landunit-level and column-level averaging and
  vector output using the hist_type1d_pertape namelist option (LAND
  for land-unit, COL for column-level).  Note that if a user asks for
  a variable at a subgrid level that is not available at that subgrid
  level, the model will crash ungracefully.  An example would be
  asking for TOT_WOODPRODC at the land-unit level when this variable
  is only available at the grid cell level, or asking for H2OSOI at
  the pft-level when H2OSOI is a column-level variable.  Code may be
  added in a future tag that will inform the user of the error.

* Add usermods dir for recommended clm5 crop default output. To use
  the usermod when creating a new case:

  ./create_newcase --compset HIST_DATM%GSWP3_CLM50%BGC-CROP_SICE_SOCN_MOSART_CISM2_SWAV \
                   --user-mods-dir clm/clm5_OutputCrop \
                   ... machine, compiler, grid, case name, etc...


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

None, but see note below in testing about c14 bombspike test.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

  The default history output has been reduced. You may need to
  explicitly request fields of interest from the namelist.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: unknown

  yellowstone intel baselines were generated for clm4_5_16_r242

  Baselines comparisons for clm45/clm5 tests show:
    1. changes in fields sizes (expected, restrict vertical fields to nlevsoi)
    
    2. different fields on current and baseline files (expected, new default active/inactive)

    3. no RMS differences, except the following tests:

       These tests failed baseline comparisons with RMS differences in
       testing due to the soy nitrogen double accounting fix.

    The ciso-c14 bombspike1963 test failed baseline test with RMS
    differences in C14_* fields on cheyenne_intel. This did not have
    differences when tested against r273 and yellowstone_intel. This
    seems to be intermintent, there was at least one test run with
    r242 cheyenne_intel where this passed without RMS differences.

One-line Summary: Use finundated streams for CLM50, and use ndep if it comes from cpl

Purpose of changes
------------------

For methane, read in inversion for TWS to Prigent Satellite dataset from a streams file for CLM50. For
CLM45 still read in ZWT inversion parameters from the surface dataset. You can read it from the streams
file if you provide it to the namelist. Answers change for CLM50BGC compsets because of this change to
methane. The change does affect results outside of methane after enough time.

Add option to use nitrogen deposition sent from the coupler rather than from datasets (from mvertens).

    is reading ZWT inversion parameters from the surface dataset

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): ZWT_inversion for CLM45 and TWS_inversion for CLM50
   for inundated fraction

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): Add 2000 T42 fsurdata file

One-line Summary: Fix ch4 subtle dependence on processor count

Purpose of changes
------------------

When we moved to using interpolated initial conditions in most cases, long tests
that change processor counts (ERP, PEM) began to fail (bug 2458). I tracked this
problem down to annsum_npp, annsum_counter, and specifically bug 1597.

I found that, in both the original finidat and finidat_interp_dest, we have:

- For coltype = 1, counter can be 0, 3600 or 5400

- For coltype = 200-something (crop), counter is always 5400

- For other coltypes, counter = 0 (but these shouldn't matter)

My best guess is that there is some interaction between (1) the history of an
initial conditions file, and (2) dynamic landunits, which causes annsum_counter
to differ by column. Specifically, with (1): I think that problems arise when an
initial conditions file has (at some point in its history) arisen from a run
that didn't run for a complete year; e.g., this can happen in the course of
making an interp'ed initial conditions file - for which we typically run for one
or a few time steps. This can lead to a misalignment of the resetting of
annsum_counter relative to when dynamic landunits kick in, and thus the counter
can differ for different columns.

This tag fixes the problem by making each column dependent on its own count,
rather than using the count from the first column on that MPI task.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 1597: awkward conditionals to determine end of year in CN AnnualUpdate
- 2458: ERP clm5 restart failure in clm4_5_16_r237

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID): [If none, remove this line]
- https://github.com/NCAR/CLM/issues/7 : CN annsum_counter can trigger mid-year,
  and at different times for different columns

  Decision in talking with Erik and Keith was that we would not try to resolve
  this right now - it seems that it can cause a bit of confusion, but no
  scientific problems as far as we can tell.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Many configurations, when run for at least a year
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Larger than roundoff; expected to be same climate, but not investigated carefully.

      Answer changes can appear whenever we have an initial conditions file
      where different columns have different values of the annsum_counter
      restart field. This is the case for present-day restart files, as well as
      at least one year-1850 restart file
      (clmi.I1850CRUCLM45BGC.0241-01-01.1.9x2.5_g1v6_simyr1850_c170308.nc).

      The impact of this problem is expected to be small, at least if the
      differences in annsum_counter values are small (which they are for the two
      initial conditions files I have checked, and I expect this is the case for
      others, too): In this case, the impact is that some annually-accumulated
      fields reach their end-of-year mark a few time steps too early or late.

      However, I have not investigated the impact of this bug fix carefully.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

needs to send the snow capping flux directly to runoff. Previously, this value
was a logical. However, we (Bill Lipscomb and Bill Sacks) realized that this
really needs to be real-valued - having a value between 0 and 1 where a CLM cell
partially overlaps the CISM domain. This is needed for complete conservation
when we are running with a fully-coupled (two-way-coupled) glc component.

This changes answers for cases with two-way-coupled CISM, but does NOT change
answers for the typical one-way-coupled (%NOEVOLVE) case.

Main changes are from Bill Lipscomb.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- There is some duplicate logic between CLM and the coupler in determining the
  fraction of the CLM grid cell that overlaps with the active glc
  domain. Ideally, we'd move all of the relevant logic into the coupler and
  avoid needing it in CLM. See the TODO note in glc2lndMod.F90

One-line Summary: ED is now an external library 'fates'

Purpose of changes
------------------

The ongoing evolution of the 'ED' library is being done by
NGEE-Tropics as 'FATES'. This change removes the 'ED' directory and
replace it with link an external release of fates.

The primary changes are to finish creation of an interface layer to
separate fates from CLM. There are also numerous science improvements
in the linked fates library.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 2459 - patch from Erik Kluzek

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

 * ED has been completely rebranded as fates. This includes:
    * New/renamed compsets - ICLM45ED is now ICLM45FATES, ICLM50FATES.
    * Renamed name list variables:
       * use_ed --> use_fates
       * use_ed_spitfire --> use_fates_spitfire
        
    * New namelist variable: fates_paramfile, this can point to either
      the clm parameter file, or a standalone fates parameter file
      depending on user preference. All fates dimensions and variables
      are namespaced by 'fates_'.

 * Fates can not restart and interpolate from a CLM-{SP,CN,BGC}
   initial conditions file. It must be run in cold start or restart
   from a CLM-fates restart file.

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing:

 * Add tests to aux_clm45 using the fates compsets and renamed the ed
   test mods to fates and fatesFire.

 * Added the cheyenne_intel test list to aux_clm45

 * all namelist tests are expected to fail because of use_ed -> use_fates rename.

One-line Summary: Latest parameter file and some changes for CLM50, CLM45-transient changes answers also

Purpose of changes
------------------

Adjustments to CLM50 climate from Keith Oleson, Peter Lawrence, Fang Li, Rosie Fisher, Danica Lombardozzi, Will Weider, 
Yaqiong Lu, Ben Sanderson, and David Lawrence.  Some tweaks to the code and to parameters and the parameter file for CLM50. 
Use Medlyn 2011 stomotal conductance rather than Ball-Berry. Modify photosynthesis and leaf maintence respiration for crop. 
Limit irrigation if river flow is on and the storage drops below a threshold. Modify a long list of parameter values including 
41 items on the parameter file.  Only harvest up to 98% to allow for regrowth and divide by several terms rather than just deadstem. 
Add slash harvesting fields (debris left from harvesting). Add in a hack to read in FWS_TWS_A/B if they are on the surface 
dataset and use them to calculate finundation based on TWS rather than exponential function based on ZWT. For fires change an 
if statement from checking if atmosphere is non-freezing to a specific soil layer.  If crops have hit peak LAI set leaf allocation 
to a small value. Make sure some retranslocation terms are positive. Let lnc in Photosynthesis max out at 10. Only vary baset 
for crops for spring wheat and sugarcane (irrigated and non) rather than all crops.

Coupled crop cases will change since we now use the radiation time-step for fertilization rather than the model time-step.
CLM45 cases remain the same with the exception for transient cases which change answers due to the change in how
harvest is handled. Fix a few minor bugs that came in with clm4_5_15_r236 with specific datasets and finidat file handling in scripts
(bugs 2448-2451).


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

  2452  --- Change to divisor for harvest and also allow for regrowth
  2451  --- Bad comment marker in cropf10IC testmods
  2450  --- Make sure finidat is reset after setting to coldstart
  2449  --- Add no fail to init_interp_attributes and use_init_interp, needed for DV cases where interpolated IC files aren't there
  2448  --- Misnamed dataset in CLM xml database

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
  2457  --- Remove FINUN_HIST from history
  2456  --- Remove extra settings of use_init_interp
  2455  --- PGI specific error at initialization
  2454  --- masterlist_addfld getting confused with names for species...
  2453  --- Memory error with restart variable vcmx25t

Tag name:  clm4_5_15_r236
Originator(s):  erik (Erik Kluzek)
Date: Mon May  1 01:42:23 MDT 2017
One-line Summary: New surface datasets, and landuse.timeseries files, as well as interpolating initial conditions for almost all cases

Purpose of changes
------------------

New fsurdat and landuse.timeseries datasets for almost all resolutions.
New initial conditions datasets pointed to as much as possible for all resolutions (have ability to turn off to COLDSTART for some tests).
Normally model will now die, if it can't find initial conditions to interpolate from.
Reasonable f09 and f19 PE layout for cheyenne. Fix another issue on Cheyenne. Add new pgi/intel tests for hobart.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
   2445 -- ED not working with new datasets
   2444 -- dimensional change in URBAN_AC/URBAN_HEAT for interpolation of restart files
   2441 -- fire emissions on cheyenne
   2291 -- fire emissions with gnu compiler sometimes NaN, sometimes change answers for trivial changes
   2239 -- need new initial conditions files with extra metadata on them

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
  2447 -- Floating overflow for CLM50CROP case on hobart_nag in Photosynthesis
  #1215 -- (in this version of cime) TestStatus sometimes needs to have write permission added
  #? -- manage_case doesn't work
  #? -- ./xmlquery --list-all doesn't work


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): 

   All initial conditions have to be interpolated now, but there are ones that can be interpolated from for standard cases
   NOTE NOW IF YOU WANT TO DO A COLD START USING ARBITRARY INITIAL CONDITIONS SET CLM_FORCE_COLDSTART=on
   Also the model will normally fail if it can't find initial conditions close enough to interpolate from

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): A close finidat file will almost always be set

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): 

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): New fsurdat/finidat/landuse.timeseris

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

Changes to tests or testing: New pgi/intel tests for hobart

   Expected fails removed: bug 2239, 2291, and added SMS_Ld5_D_P24x1.f10_f10.IHISTCLM50BGC.hobart_nag.clm-monthl for bug 2447

One-line Summary: Zero dynbal fluxes if namelist variable is set

Purpose of changes
------------------

Some fully-active system tests were dying due to too-large sensible heat fluxes
(thousands or 10s of thousands of W m-2) generated from the dynbal
adjustments. These large fluxes arose because these tests trigger daily dynamics
of CISM (via the test_coupling namelist option), rather than the typical annual
coupling. The annual dribblers see these mid-year adjustments and apply them all
in a single time step, rather than spreading them throughout the year.

The changes in this tag allow you to set a namelist variable
(for_testing_zero_dynbal_fluxes) to force the dynbal fluxes to zero. Typically,
this namelist variable should only be used for testing: setting it to
.true. breaks water and energy conservation. We will set this to true in the
fully-active tests that use daily CISM dynamics.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

One-line Summary: Update rtm and mosart externals

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update externals to rtm1_0_61 and mosart1_0_23.

Includes change to python build-namelist (rtm, mosart), histfile
bugfix (rtm, mosart), and science bugfix / changes (mosart).

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 2434

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

  python build namelist for rtm will no longer automatically point rtm
  to a clm restart file. rtm should be configured to generate and read
  it's own restart files.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing) : none


---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:

rtm was not outputing a restart file for the ref run in SSP tests, but
was attempting to read one during the second run because of
build-namelist changes in rtm1_0_60. All SSP tests in aux_clm45 and
prebeta were changed to use a new test mod, rtmColdSSP, that forces
rtm to do a cold start when coming out of spinup.

Old RCP/clm40 tests that were not compatible with new rtm
build-namelist behavior were removed.

Code reviewed by: self, discussion with Erik Kluzek.

      * SSP tests passed functionality, but don't have baselines
        because of test-mod change. Manually ran cprc to compare with
        clm4_5_15_r233, files were reported as identical.

One-line Summary: Some small changes that affect both clm4_5 and clm5_0 answers (can be considered bug fixes to clm4_5)

Purpose of changes
------------------

A set of some small changes that affect answers for both CLM45 and CLM50. A fix to a rare problem where soil albedo
could go negative from Keith Oleson and Sean Swenson, by making sure a calculated value could not go below a small value.
A change from Will Weider to lower leaf maintence respiration (LMR) for low LAI. Always calculate btran2 even for low
temperatures and/or low liquid water this lowers fires in boreal forests. For crop at peak LAI set hui to max of hui and 
huigrain. Change the handling of GDDPLANT accumulator field from Keith Oleson. Get rid of the use_voc logic that just
prevented MEGAN from activating for crop, since now MEGAN handles the crop case (since clm4_5_13_r204).

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------
   2437 -- lower leaf maintence respiration for low LAI
   2436 -- some adjustments to crop
   2435 -- always calculate btran to lower fires in boreal forests
   2431 -- Rare condition under which soil albedo goes negative
   2368 -- Remove use_voc as MEGAN can now work with crop

One-line Summary: Add option to reset snow pack over non-glacier columns

Purpose of changes
------------------

When going from a CLM spinup under one set of atmospheric forcings to a
different set of atmospheric forcings, there is the possibility that columns
that reached large snow depths in the spinup should really have only seasonal
snow cover under the new atmosphere. This is a particular concern for the LIWG
in some areas of Greenland that have only seasonal snow cover: there is a
concern that the offline spinup can bake in too-high snow cover in some
regions. This can especially be a problem because of feedbacks: starting out
with a too-high snow cover can cool the overlying atmosphere, leading to
persistence of the snow pack. This is also a problem because, once the snow pack
becomes very deep, it seems that its refreezing can make it less likely that the
snow pack will ever melt.

To deal with these issues, this tag introduces a new namelist item,
reset_snow. This is typically .false. If you set it to .true., then all snow in
non-glacier columns is reset to 35 mm SWE over the first few time steps of the
run.

This resetting is accomplished via the snow capping mechanism. This
implementation was chosen because it is challenging to reset the snow pack
directly, since there are so many snow-related variables that must be kept in
sync. The snow capping mechanism already handles this properly, so it's easiest
to reuse this mechanism. However, unlike standard snow capping, the flux of snow
lost through this resetting is sent into a new flux that simply disappears into
nothingness - rather than being sent to glc and/or rof. Thus, note that - by
design! - the flux from this snow resetting breaks conservation: We do not want
this lost snow to affect ocean circulation, since this is essentially just a
mechanism for adjusting an initial conditions file.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Specifying reset_snow = .true. will lead to a loss of conservation for the
  first few time steps of the run

One-line Summary: Fix dynamic landunits water and energy conservation

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fixes water and energy conservation with dynamic landunits. This conservation
works by summing the water and energy contents of each grid cell before and
after the dynamic landunits transitions, then dealing with the difference
through runoff and sensible heat fluxes. However, the code for counting the
water and energy contents was wrong - slightly wrong for water, and
substantially wrong for energy. The energy counts were 6 orders of magnitude too
small, and also were missing some terms.

This tag fixes these counts, and reconciles the dynamic landunits water and
energy accounting with the accounting done for the balance checks. It also
refactors some of the code used in the balance checks to facilitate code sharing
between various places.

Also: adds wa_col (water in the unconfined aquifer) to the list of fields copied
to newly-initializing columns, to avoid spurious dynlu adjustment fluxes due to
changes in wa_col.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):

        dynamic landunits (transient glacier, transient crop): change by about
        6 orders of magnitude

    (5) Changes in transient crop cases due to copying wa_col to
        newly-initiating columns (though answer changes may be minor for clm5
        cases?)

One-line Summary: Update cime and make some changes to drv_flds_in namelist, fix some minor bugs

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update cime to a version with an updated top level directory structure. It also fixes a problem
with a CLM test.

The new cime version has a new directory structure, and updates the XML schema for namelist files
from verison 1 to version 2. Currently the perl namelist code can NOT read version 2. Hence, a local
copy of the version 1 files for the drv_flds_in fields was added to CLM. Also the use of the datm
namelist files for some tools was dropped -- I think that's OK though.

Fix two minor bugs.

The new cime has a few improvements. It now adjusts the PIO namelist when the PE layout changes.
There's a new option to case.setup "--no-adjust-pio" to not do that. --mpilib option was added
to create_test. You can remove your bld directory area without having to rerun case.setup.

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): None

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

   case.setup has a new option --no-adjust-pio

   The user now can rm -rf their build area and rebuild without having
     to re-run case.setup.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): None

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): None

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

   CIME now normally adjusts PIO layout if you change the PE layout.

   Also puts a copy of namelist definition and defaults for drv_flds_in in CLM.
   This copy needs to be doubly maintained with the versions in the driver and in CAM.
   The advantage of having a copy is because each copy is using a different version of
   the xml schema, and potentially the driver might have additional fields that interact
   with other components besides CLM. Currently the only drv_flds_in fields are all shared
   between only CAM and CLM. But, the fact that there are duplicated copies does mean
   changes in any one of those components will need to go into the other two.

   Also removes the datm namelist files read in tools such as queryDefaultNamelist.pl.
   I think this is OK, as this connection may no longer be needed. It does make the
   listDefaultNamelist.pl less useful, but I think that's OK as well.

   add --mpilib option to create_test

One-line Summary: Improve performance of dynamic landunits code

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is to improve the performance of the column state updates portion of
the dynamic landunits code. In optimized, global runs, this piece of the code
(dyn_cnbal_col) was taking 3 - 5% of total CLM runtime. Its cost was greater in
global debug runs (~ 10 - 15%), and even greater in single-point debug runs (30
- 40%).

Here I have introduced a variable that tracks whether there are any changes in
area in this time step for each clump; if not, then it avoids doing most of the
work in dyn_cnbal_col.

This tag also fixes the fortran unit tests with the new cime version: the
necessary changes were accidentally dropped from the last tag.

One-line Summary: Update cime, mosart and cism to a version that is cesm2_0_beta05 or part of beta06

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update cime version and cism to version that similar to that in cesm2_0_beta05, but with many fixes in cime for
clm. Also update mosart to fix a bug on hobart. The update of cism does change answers as it makes CISM2 the
default with the new 4km greenland grid.

There are some user improvements in the latest cime version. Long term archiving issues are fixed. A file
called CASEROOT is added to your case's $RUNDIR so that you can easily see where your source code is. A few
options were added to create_newcase and create_clone (see details below). 

NOTE: You will need to use the "--run-unsupported" to create_newcase for compsets/grids that aren't tested or supported!!!

Fix a few other existing bugs. Fix createcrop_landunit to work with the new CLM surface datasets. Bring in a
workaround for a compiler bug with intel 17 and 18. Bring in a version of PTCLM that works with the latest cime.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
   2417 -- fix createcrop_landunit for new datasets with 16 PFTs
   2418 -- fix grid match for config_compsets.xml (cime issue 1079 still there)
   2424 -- Update mosart to 1_0_20 to fix the nag bug
   2479 -- workaround for intel compiler bug
   2357 -- PTCLM broken in cime5

One-line Summary: Fix GDD accumulation in new crop columns

Purpose of changes
------------------

For newly-initiating crop columns in the middle of a run, the 20-year-average
GDD variables (gdd*20) were not being initialized correctly. They were starting
as spval, and then taking essentially forever to come down to some reasonable
value. This caused major problems for both dynamic landunits and when running
init_interp from one crop run to another, where the new run had some new crop
types - such as going from a run without irrigation to a run with irrigation.

This tag fixes these problems.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- If you do a CROP run, setting use_init_interp to .true., and pointing to a
  previous initial conditions file generated with a crop run (thus having
  restyear > 0 on the restart file), then GDD accumulation will get reset. This
  means that the first year of your run won't have any crop growth. After this
  initial "burn-in" period, it will run fine. This is only an issue when using
  initial conditions generated prior to this tag, and is only an issue when
  using init_interp.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

    yellowstone_intel - ok
    yellowstone_pgi - ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - ok

    ok means tests pass, some expected baseline failures:

    Baseline comparisons fail because GDD accumulation is now fixed for
    transient crops:

        SMS_D_Ly6_Mmpi-serial.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHISTCLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_pgi.clm-cropMonthOutput

    These tests point to a previously-spun-up crop file, and use init_interp. I
    have adjusted this file to add the new patch-level nyrs_crop_active
    variable, which I set to 30 for all active crop PFTs (in agreement with the
    old restyear). However, this initial conditions file does not have any
    non-irrigated crop PFTs! So crop behavior was wrong in the baseline run,
    because non-irrigated crops started with spval gdd*20 values.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
      - Transient crop cases
      - Any crop case for which initial conditions are init_interp'ed from a
        previous crop case: nyrs_crop_active is reset to 0 in this case
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Potentially new climate for transient crop cases

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? n/a

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: n/a

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: n/a

One-line Summary: Tweaks for glaciers and snow

Purpose of changes
------------------

A number of answer-changing tweaks for glaciers and snow, mainly with the intent
of improving glacial melt over Greenland in CESM2.

(1) New longwave downscaling parameterization, based on Van Tricht et al. (2016,
    TC) Figure 6, doi:10.5194/tc-10-2379-2016. This uses a simple linear lapse
    rate for LW radiation, which seems better supported by observations than the
    old approach based on blackbody radiation relationships. Two new namelist
    parameters control this behavior: lapse_rate_longwave and
    longwave_downscaling_limit. This changes answers for all cases with multiple
    elevation classes - i.e., all cases with CISM (IG, etc.), just over the
    regions with downscaling (Greenland and Antarctica). This change is from Leo
    van Kampenhout.

(2) Modified the parameterization of snow cover fraction during melt to improve
    glacial melt over Greenland in CESM2:

    (a) New value for n_melt (parameter controlling snow cover fraction as snow
        melts) over glc_mec columns for CLM5. The previous value of 10 resulted
        in near-100% snow cover fraction over glaciers. The new value of 1
        allows snow cover fractions more similar to other landcover
        types. n_melt_glcmec is a new namelist parameter. This changes answers
        for all CLM5 cases with glc_mec (i.e., with CISM), just over glc_mec
        landunits.

    (b) For all landcover types, maintain snow cover fraction at 100% when
        h2osno exceeds 2m SWE in CLM5. This is important in conjunction with
        (a), in order to avoid snow cover fraction dropping significantly below
        100% when very deep (e.g., 10m) snow packs begin to melt. This is
        controlled by a new namelist parameter, int_snow_max, which can be set
        to a very large value to retrieve the old behavior. This changes answers
        for all CLM5 cases; in principle, it changes answersfor all landunits,
        but in practice, this should only matter where we have a very deep snow
        pack - typically, just in regions where the snow persists for more than
        a year.

    These two changes were proposed in a discussion with Leo van Kampenhout,
    Bill Lipscomb, Dave Lawrence and Sean Swenson.

(3) Set the ddz3 term controlling snow compaction for glaciers and wetlands in
    the same way as for soil and crop landunits. This should have been included
    in clm4_5_14_r222 (which brought in consistency in the treatment of snow
    cover fraction in glacier & wetland landunits), but was overlooked in that
    tag. This changes answers for all cases, just over glacier, glacier_mec and
    wetland columns. This change was reviewed by Sean Swenson and Leo van
    Kampenhout.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variables:
  - lapse_rate: the temperature lapse rate for downscaling over ice sheets
    (default kept the same as before, though there may be roundoff-level
    differences due to the precision of the namelist parameter)
  - lapse_rate_longwave: the longwave radiation lapse rate for downscaling over
    ice sheets

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Larger than roundoff. Expect at least small regional climate differences -
      specifically over Greenland and Antarctica.
    
    Answer changes are from:

    (1) New longwave downscaling parameterization. This changes answers for all
        cases with multiple elevation classes - i.e., all cases with CISM (IG,
        etc.), just over the regions with downscaling (Greenland and
        Antarctica).

    (2) New value for n_melt over glc_mec columns for CLM5. This changes answers
        for all CLM5 cases with glc_mec (i.e., with CISM), just over glc_mec
        landunits.

    (3) Modified parameterization of snow cover fraction during melt to maintain
        snow cover fraction at 100% when h2osno exceeds 2m SWE in CLM5. This
        changes answers for all CLM5 cases; in principle, it changes answersfor
        all landunits, but in practice, this should only matter where we have a
        very deep snow pack - typically, just in regions where the snow persists
        for more than a year.

    (4) Set the ddz3 term controlling snow compaction for glaciers and wetlands
        in the same way as for soil and crop landunits. This changes answers for
        all cases, just over glacier, glacier_mec and wetland columns.

One-line Summary: Handle patch-level C&N variables correctly with dynamic landunits

Purpose of changes
------------------

The infrastructure for handling conservation of patch-level C&N variables when
subgrid weights changed was only considering changes in patch weights on the
COLUMN. For dynamic landunits - where whole columns and landunits can change in
area - this needs to consider changes in patch weights on the GRIDCELL. This tag
makes this change.

In addition, this makes the fire code work correctly with changing column /
landunit areas: Similarly to the other C&N variables, the variable that triggers
landcover-related fires was previously only considering changes in patch weights
on the column.

Also, treat patch-level crop-specific variables (grain pools and
cropseed[c/n]_deficit) in DynamicPatchAdjustments routines. C/N in the grain
pool is sent to the crop product pool via a new flux
(dwt_crop_productc_gain_patch / dwt_crop_productn_gain_patch).


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

One-line Summary: Fix energy budget bug with fractional snow on glacier and wetland columns

Purpose of changes
------------------

Leo van Kampenhout discovered a bug in the surface energy budget when there is
fractional snow cover on glacier and wetland columns: frac_sno_eff was being
treated inconsistently for these landcover types.

Note that the old code did not conserve energy due to this bug!

The fix slightly increases melt rates over Greenland, and has other minor
effects on the simulation, but not a huge effect.

More detailed notes on the problem, from Leo, are below. However, note that we
ended up fixing the problem differently from what he suggested - based on Sean
Swenson's suggestion: We fix this by treating glaciers and wetlands the same as
soil with respect to frac_sno_eff. (Note that we still treat lakes differently
[these are handled by different code] and urban differently.)

Here are the more detailed notes from Leo:

Background:

- CLM columns are allowed to have fractional snow cover. 

- The first application of fractional snow cover is to the albedo
  calculation. This is done for every landcover type in the same fashion. This
  fractional snow cover is referred to as 'frac_sno'.

- The second type of fractional snow cover is 'frac_sno_eff', which adjusts
  surface fluxes other than shortwave radiation, such as sensible and latent
  heat. The frac_sno_eff has only been implemented for soil and crop landcover
  types.

- For all other landcovers, such as glaciers, frac_sno_eff =1.0

- As such, glaciers can have frac_sno < frac_sno_eff whereas those are otherwise
  identical

Problem:

- Frac_sno is used to compute absorbed radiation in the soil (sabg_soil) and
  snow (sabg_snow). When frac_sno < 1.0, this will lead to a positive value of
  sabg_soil at the expense of sabg_snow

- In other radiation code, notably SoilTemperatureMod.F90, the other definition
  of fractional snow cover is used (frac_sno_eff)

- For glaciers (frac_sno_eff), this means that no radiation is allowed to enter
  the soil. To my current understanding, this energy is totally lost:

                     eflx_gnet_soil = sabg_soil(p) + dlrad(p) &
                          + (1-frac_veg_nosno(p))*emg(c)*forc_lwrad(c) - lwrad_emit_soil(c) &
                          - (eflx_sh_soil(p)+qflx_ev_soil(p)*htvp(c))

    real(r8)               , intent(out)   :: hs_soil( bounds%begc: )                   ! heat flux on soil [W/m2]

                  ! separate surface fluxes for soil/snow
                  hs_soil(c) = hs_soil(c) + eflx_gnet_soil * patch%wtcol(p)

                     ! this is the snow/soil interface layer
                     rt(c,j) = t_soisno(c,j) + fact(c,j) &
                          *((1._r8-frac_sno_eff(c))*(hs_soil(c) - dhsdT(c)*t_soisno(c,j)) &
                          + cnfac*(fn(c,j) - frac_sno_eff(c) * fn(c,j-1)))

BalanceCheckMod:

- The missing energy should have been detected by BalanceCheckMod, specifically
  the check on surface energy balance:

             ! Surface energy balance
             ! Changed to using (eflx_lwrad_net) here instead of (forc_lwrad - eflx_lwrad_out) because
             ! there are longwave interactions between urban columns (and therefore patches).
             ! For surfaces other than urban, (eflx_lwrad_net) equals (forc_lwrad - eflx_lwrad_out),
             ! and a separate check is done above for these terms.

             if (.not. lun%urbpoi(l)) then
                errseb(p) = sabv(p) + sabg_chk(p) + forc_lwrad(c) - eflx_lwrad_out(p) &
                     - eflx_sh_tot(p) - eflx_lh_tot(p) - eflx_soil_grnd(p)

- Here, the total absorbed solar radiation is FSA has been been replaced by
  sabg_chk. This hides the problem, because sabg_chk itself is also flawed:

 		      ! save sabg for balancecheck, in case frac_sno is set to zero later
                     sabg_chk(p) = frac_sno_eff(c) * sabg_snow(p) + (1._r8 - frac_sno_eff(c) ) * sabg_soil(p)

- With frac_sno_eff = 1.0, this simplifies to sabg_snow. So, sabg_soil is not
  accounted for in the surface energy balance check.

Workaround:

1. Let all solar soil radiation be absorbed by snow:

SurfaceRadiationMod:

             if (frac_sno(c) < frac_sno_eff(c)) then
                ! LvK: workaround, absorb all soil radiation in snow 
                sabg_snow(p) = fsa(p)
                sabg_soil(p) = 0.0_r8
             end if

2. Recommended: let the surface energy balance use FSA :

   errseb(p) = sabv(p) + fsa(p) + forc_lwrad(c) - eflx_lwrad_out(p) &
                     - eflx_sh_tot(p) - eflx_lh_tot(p) - eflx_soil_grnd(p)

Long-term solution:

- Thought needs to be given on how SW radiation should be treated on partially
  covered glacier columns


- Allowing radiation to penetrate the soil, yet keeping frac_sno_eff = 1, is a
  possibility. This will heat the snowpack from below.


- Alternatively, we could look at implementing glacier fractional snow cover for
  surface fluxes also. Needs discussion about the physical basis & how to
  evaluate this.



Again, note that the final implementation differs from Leo's suggestion - I'm
just giving Leo's original notes for completeness.

One-line Summary: Change rain-snow partitioning and ice albedo for glacier columns

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is to change the rain-snow partitioning ramp for glacier columns,
when using clm5 physics: Rather than assuming all snow below 0 C and all rain
above 2 C, for glacier columns we now assume all snow below -2 C and all rain
above 0 C. The main motivation for this change is to increase the
otherwise-too-low glacier melt we have been seeing in recent CESM2 test
runs. The physical justification is: The old partitioning makes sense when you
have a positive atmospheric lapse rate - so slightly-above-freezing temperatures
at the surface are associated with below-freezing temperatures at the cloud
level. However, for glaciers, it is relatively common to have a temperature
inversion. Thus, we would expect a different relationship between near-surface
temperatures and phase of precipitation. This new relationship was proposed and
agreed upon by LIWG leadership, particularly Bill Lipscomb, Jan Lenaerts and Leo
van Kampenhout.

To implement this change, I have reimplemented the (simple) rain-snow
partitioning code inline, rather than using the csm_share code. In addition, I
have introduced four new namelist parameters controlling its behavior:
- precip_repartition_glc_all_snow_t
- precip_repartition_glc_all_rain_t
- precip_repartition_nonglc_all_snow_t
- precip_repartition_nonglc_all_rain_t

Also changes ice albedo (albice) for glacier columns from 0.6/0.4 (vis/nir) to
0.5/0.3, when using clm5 physics. This is based on suggestions by Jan Lenaerts,
and agreed upon by the LIWG leadership.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
Four new namelist parameters:
- precip_repartition_glc_all_snow_t
- precip_repartition_glc_all_rain_t
- precip_repartition_nonglc_all_snow_t
- precip_repartition_nonglc_all_rain_t

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
- Changed defaults for albice with CLM50

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Duplicated code for rain-snow partitioning: in CLM and csm_share (the
  csm_share version is used by datm). However, this is just a couple of lines of
  code, and it's possible that the CLM version will change in the future, so I
  felt that duplication was not a bad thing here.

One-line Summary: Fix crop seeding

Purpose of changes
------------------

The implementation of crop seeding made a few months ago didn't handle the
transfers back into the "seed deficit" (cropseedc) pool quite right. In
addition, that implementation didn't treat nitrogen. This tag fixes these
problems. In addition, it separates the seed (deficit) pools into crop seed
deficit and dwt seed deficit, and moves the latter to gridcell level (which is
needed for some upcoming work).

In the new implementation, when crops are seeded, this is tracked via
cropseedc_deficit_patch and cropseedn_deficit_patch. At the end of the growing
season, these deficits are repaid out of grain c/n, if there is enough available
grain c/n (if there is not enough available, the deficits accumulate until they
can eventually be repaid). Thus, this repayment decreases the fluxes of C & N to
the crop product pools. This new implementation was co-developed with Danica
Lombardozzi.

In addition, this tag does some other minor cleanup, as noted below.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Seed pools won't restart properly from old initial conditions files. However,
  since these seed pools were previously just used as a diagnostic, this won't
  affect the evolution of anything except for the seed pools and related summary
  variables.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- Removed a few unused diagnostic history variables

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing: nothing substantial

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Many CLM45/CLM50, but significant changes only
      for CROP
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      Larger than roundoff / same climate

      Details:

      There are differences from baseline in:

      - Crop product pools and related fluxes, including summary fluxes
        (LAND_USE_FLUX, NBP)

      - FCO2

      - PFT_CTRUNC - changed due to fix in treatment of crop seed (previously,
        substantial grain was being truncated)

      - SEEDC / SEEDN

      - STORVEGC / STORVEGN in crop tests

      - Various other summary C/N state variables

      - LITFALL for CLM50 with CROP


      Other than TOTCOLC / TOTCOLN, greater-than-roundoff diffs just in CROP
      tests and tests that have non-blank finidat (latter just in SEEDC & SEEDN,
      because we don't read in the current value of SEEDC/SEEDN). Summary
      variables have diffs in some CLM45 crop tests as well as CLM50, because of
      diffs in which summary variables include seed c/n.


   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Answer changes for CLM50 for several issues that lead to dead crops

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fix several problems that led to dead crops. latbaset was set in InitAllocate
and then reset to spval in InitHist. Set lnca to interp rather than skip for
interpolation on startup. Remove rootfr from restart unless use_dynroots is on.
Fix FERTNITRO and add BTRAN2 to history. Turn LUNA on by default for all CLM50
cases including SP. Change from Fang Li to remove fb from the calculation of
baf_crop. Fix LUNA in SP mode by setting PARi10 to a small value rather than
zero.

One-line Summary: For newly initiating columns: do not copy snow state

Purpose of changes
------------------

Keith Oleson found that, in some circumstances, the model was dying with a snow
balance error in newly initiating crop columns. We tracked this down to an
incomplete copying of the snow state from the 'template' column to the newly
initiating crop column. Our two options for solving this problem were (1) copy
the snow state more completely; or (2) do not try to copy any part of the snow
state - leaving the snow in cold start conditions for the newly initiating
column. (1) is challenging because there are so many snow variables, so we have
chosen to go with (2) for now. Thus, when a column initiates (for now, this just
applies to crop columns), we (Dave Lawrence, Keith Oleson and Bill Sacks) have
decided that we should copy only the belowground temperature and water state.

Also, some minor, unrelated changes:

(1) Fix broken unit tests

(2) Abort run if try to run use_ed with transient crops

(3) Add two single-point exact restart tests for transient crop, because we did
not have good coverage of exact restart tests for transient crop before this

Answer changes

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, in principle - but not in the test suite

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM50 with transient crops
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Assumed to be larger than roundoff, but only slightly, and only rare
      answer changes

      I did not observe any answer changes in the test suite. But in principle,
      this could change answers for any transient crop run, as evidenced by the
      change in behavior seen in Keith Oleson's transient crop run with and
      without this fix. It just seems like the conditions in which this matters
      only occur rarely.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse

One-line Summary: Bug fix for snow radiation absorption

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bug fix from Leo van Kampenhout regarding snow radiation absorption: Remove
multipliers of (1.-albsnd(c,ib)) or (1.-albsni(c,ib)) in the calculation of
flx_absdv, flx_absiv, flx_absdn, flx_absin.

This stops this conditional in SurfaceRadiationMod from being triggered every
time step:

             if (abs(sabg_snl_sum-sabg_snow(p)) > 0.00001_r8) then

The triggering of this conditional led to an unintended constant partitioning of
radiation through the snowpack: 75% of radiation was absorbed in the top layer,
25% in the bottom layer.

In the old code, Leo found that sabg_snow(p) is over three times as big as
sabg_snl_sum , so these are certainly not roundoff problems.

With the fix, the conditional is no longer triggered at every time
step. Possible explanation: the factors flx_absd_snw and flx_absi_snw are
already accounted for albedo, because they are "absorbed flux per unit incident
flux at top of snowpack" according to SnowSnicarMod.F90.

Sean Swenson tested this, and says: I agree with leo; in fact the sum of the
flx_ terms should be the total absorption, or 1-albedo.  When I remove the
albedo modification leo suggested, I see most of the cases where the if-block is
triggered go away.  Those that remain are much smaller (the abs() in the if
block is ~1.e--4).  I don't know if this is a precision issue, or an indication
of a remaining bug.  Or it could be those cases for which the if-block was meant
to correct originally.

Sean later added: a couple more pieces of information: 1) the if-statement is
still needed.  If it is removed, a balance check error will abort the model.  2)
in SurfaceAlbedoMod, I tested the equality of sum_over_layers(flx_absdn) and
(1.0 - albsnd).  For direct beam, they were equal, but occassionally for ib=2
(near infrared), they were slightly different.  These were the same points that
were then triggered by the if block in SurfaceRadiation.  This may point to
something within the snicar_rt subroutine, but I don't plan on following this
issue further.

Mark Flanner added: I will note that there is an energy conservation check in
the snicarRT code which should ensure that the sum of absorption in all snow
layers never differs substantially (>0.00001) from what is expected from albedo
and transmittance.  If it does, the model aborts.  This is true, however, only
at the snow column level, so I suspect the issue you identified ultimately
relates either to (1) fractional snow cover and merging of sub-grid energy
fluxes to the gridcell level and/or (2) a change in the number of snow layers in
between the calculations of snow albedo and absorbed energy flux.  I think (2)
is what necessitated the patch in the first place.  I could be wrong.

One-line Summary: Update mksurfdata_map to work with new updated datasets from Peter, and use hand-edited 
                  surfdata/landuse.timeseries datasets for f09/f19

Purpose of changes
------------------

Use new rawdatasets from Peter Lawrence that have crop landunit changing in size as well as specific crop 
and natural vegetation types. Modify mksurfdata_map to use new fields for fertilizer for each crop type.
Add in harvest fields to both surface dataset as well as landuse.timeseries dataset. Also add in two
new fields: UNREPRESENTED_PFT_LULCC, UNREPRESENTED_CFT_LULCC for the impact of landuse changes for 
natural and crop vegetation types. Currently these two fields are zeroed out. But, they will be added in
with a new update to the datasets.

Implement crop fertilizer for each crop type into CLM. The fertilizer is also moved from one crop
type to another by the mapping system between the different crop types (to handle unrepresented crop
types by mapping them to one that is represented). The new datasets also have harvest fields in units by
mass rather than area. This requires new surface and landuse.timeseries datasets. We have hand-edited 
versions from Peter Lawrence for f09 and f19. The older datasets for other resolutions still work, but 
they don't have the new fertilizer field so anthropogenic fertilizer is zeroed out.

NOTE: Capability to create rcp scenarios for landuse.timeseries was removed from mksurfdata_map.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
   2386 -- buildnamelist unit tester can't compare to itself

One-line Summary: Update column states based on dwt terms between dyn_cnbal_patch and dyn_cnbal_col, and minor fixes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is to move the update of column states based on dwt terms (which
come from shrinking patches) to earlier in the time step - specifically, between
dyn_cnbal_patch and dyn_cnbal_col. This includes updating the seed pools and
decomp_[c/n]pools_vr_col.

This change is important when there are changing column areas: In order to
conserve C & N, we need to transfer the mass from the dwt terms to the
column-level pools before executing the code to conserve the column-level state
variables. For example, if the natural vegetated column shrinks (with a
corresponding shrinkage of each patch on the column), and is replaced by crop:
Then the dwt terms from the shrinking patches (assuming this was handled
correctly - fix coming in an upcoming tag...) add some C & N to the below-ground
pools. But some of this C & N needs to end up in the growing crop column. Since
the column-level conservation operates on state variables (not fluxes), this
only works properly if the mass from the dwt fluxes is added to the states
before dyn_cnbal_col.

In addition, this tag fixes a number of minor problems:

(1) Separates the crop uses of seed(c/n)_to_leaf from the dwt uses. This is
    needed for the main change to work correctly.

(2) Allows longer history field names in hist_fincl and hist_fexcl

(3) Fixes SNOINTABS diagnostic field (bug 2321)

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM50 in these configurations:
      - All transient cases (HIST, RCP, DV): changes due to the main changes in
        this tag
      - All CROP cases: changes answers in DWT_SEEDC_TO_LEAF and
        DWT_SEEDN_TO_LEAF diagnostic fields
      - Many cases: differences in SNOINTABS diagnostic field. From one test
        (LII_D_Ld3.f19_g16_gl5.IG1850CLM45.yellowstone_intel.clm-glcMEC_spunup_1way),
        there are diffs of up to 0.06. No diffs over Antarctica or most of
        Greenland (though there are some diffs on the southern tip of
        Greenland). Lots of other diffs in the northern hemisphere mid-high
        latitudes. This is as expected: expect diffs in vegetated areas, but not
        in glacier.
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Larger than roundoff; not investigated as to whether this is new climate,
      but expected not to be

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Bump science version number due to changes in clm4_5_13_r211

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bump science version number only. This is the same code base as
clm4_5_13_r211. No additional testing was done.

clm4_5_13_r211 has a significant change in behavior for transient cases, for
CLM45 as well as CLM50 cases. Thus, we are incrementing the science version
number.

One-line Summary: Apply transient land cover and harvest all at once in first time step of year

Purpose of changes
------------------

Scientists have found it problematic to have land cover change and harvest
interpolated throughout the year: By having just a bit of deforestation done in
each time step, the forest can regrow, so that you never see the full,
appropriate impacts of land cover change.

This tag changes the behavior of both land cover change (transient PFTs) and
harvest so that they are applied all at once in the first time step of a given
year.

This new behavior is consistent with the pre-existing timing of transient crops
and transient glaciers: Now all land cover changes happen all at once on the
first time step of the year.

For the fire code, we pass a dribbled version of the land cover change - i.e., a
version that smooths the area changes over the year, similarly to what was done
before. This is important because the fire code involves interactions between
the current time step's change in area and the current time step's climate. So,
if the fire code only saw area changes on Jan 1, it could only generated
deforestation fires on Jan 1 (I think). Note there is some inconsistency now,
since the above-ground C/N biomass is all adjusted at once on Jan 1, so the fire
code operates on the already-adjusted biomass. This could be problematic in
principle if there were relatively large changes in area in a given year, but
Fang Li believes this won't cause major problems in practice, since (1) area
changes are typically small, (2) the carbon fluxes from fire are just
diagnostic, and (3) the bigger impact of deforestation fires is as a trigger for
other fires.

In addition, for fluxes passed to the atmosphere from land cover change and
harvest, we dribble these fluxes over the year, avoiding pulsed fluxes on
Jan. 1.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All transient cases (HIST/RCP) with CLM45/CLM50; also DV cases
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      For transient cases: Larger than roundoff; unsure whether this is climate changing

      For DV cases, just roundoff-level changes in FCO2, LAND_USE_FLUX, NBP - I
      think from the dribbling of fluxes that are generated on the first time
      step of each year.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Change definition of NBP; bring back some r205 changes that were lost in r207

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes definition of NBP to match the definition used by CMIP: Now NBP includes
all terms that contribute to the net carbon exchange between land and
atmosphere.

Also, moves both NBP and NEE diagnostics to the gridcell level, rather than the
column level - so you can no longer see column-by-column values for these
diagnostics. The move of NBP to gridcell-level is needed because it now includes
some gridcell-level quantities; the move of NEE to gridcell-level is needed to
support some upcoming changes.

Removes NET_CARBON_EXCHANGE diagnostic output because this is now redundant with
NBP.

Also, brings back some r205 changes that were lost in r207 - most notably, the
fix for the MEGAN crash due to negative intracellular co2.

One-line Summary: Rework irrigation; remove glc_smb logical

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is a complete rework of the irrigation algorithm. This reworks the
trigger and target for irrigation to be based on soil physical properties,
removing the dependence on btran and smpso (which were problematic in
conjunction with PHS). With the current out-of-the-box parameter values,
irrigation is substantially lower than before.

In addition, this reworks the river volume-based limitation. One change to the
volr-based limitation is that we now apply the limit to the deficit computed in
calcIrrigationNeeded - rather than applying the limit in applyIrrigation. The
point of this is to avoid problems that arise due to evolving VOLR - e.g., if we
had calculated irrigation demand such that VOLR was just barely big enough, then
we apply irrigation for some time steps, then we get an updated VOLR which is
lower due to these irrigation withdrawals - the old implementation would impose
an unnecessary limit on the irrigation to be applied for the rest of this
day. It's hard to see a clean way around this problem, given that VOLR is
updated in some but not all CLM time steps. So we're going to impose the limit
on irrigation deficit, rather than on the time step-by-time-step flux. The
downside here is that it's somewhat more likely that irrigation would try to
draw volr negative, if volr has been evolving for other reasons.

Also, this tag pulls out the parameters controlling irrigation to namelist.

Also reworks the limit_irrigation namelist parameter, changing it to
limit_irrigation_if_rof_enabled. This was a problem before, in that we needed to
remember to set it to false whenever we ran without an active ROF model (e.g.,
during spinup); now runtime logic handles that automatically. (We considered
trying to have limit_irrigation set properly by build-namelist, but that turns
out to be tricky because there are a number of ways in which you can end up with
an inactive ROF model.)

Also removes the glc_smb logical: this has been unused for quite a while (we
have always assumed it's true).

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

One-line Summary: PHS - Calculate separate root water uptake resistances for soil and root pathways

Purpose of changes
------------------

PHS changes from Sean Swenson. Root water uptake resistances
calculated separately for soil and root pathways.  These resistances
are added in series to give a soil to root resistance that replaces
the ad hoc expression used in the original code.  History variables
added for soil and root resistances, as well as a variable 'QPHSNEG'
obtained by summing negative transpiration terms in each soil layer.

One-line Summary: Bugfix for Luna causing arctic to die

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bugfix from Keith Oleson to prevent Luna from causing the arctic to
die.

Bug 2366 prevented a divide by zero in Luna, but it sets Jmax/Vcmax to
zero. This causes plants in the arctic to never start growing and
hence never get any leaf nitrogen. The fix tested by Keith Oleson is
to set them to the default values that Luna uses when it can't
converge.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 2379

Bugs introduced: re-opening 2291. An old problem with fire emissions
fields and gnu has resurfaced. This is a two line science change
in clm5-bgc-luna that is unlikely to caused this regression.

One-line Summary: Add diagnostics for snow and glacier; fix crash in Megan

Purpose of changes
------------------

Most changes are to add new diagnostics fields related to the snow pack, and
diagnostic fields that are averaged just over istice/istice_mec landunits
(fields ending with _ICE). These changes are from from Leo van Kampenhout
(l.vankampenhout@uu.nl).

In addition:

(1) Fix to prevent negative (or very small positive) values of intracellular
    leaf CO2. This just affects Megan emissions, and only has a small
    effect. This change is needed to prevent a crash in Megan due to negative
    values of these variables. This fix is from Keith Oleson.

(2) Ensure that we don't try to do any downscaling over urban points; this is
    not currently allowed (see bug 2377). This change is needed in case there is
    an overlap between active urban points and the CISM domain: without this
    change, urban points in the CISM domain would be inside the downscaling
    filter, which would then cause an abort in check_downscale_consistency.

One-line Summary: A few answer changing bug fixes

Purpose of changes
------------------

This brings in some simple answer changing bug fixes. And some non-answer changing bug fixes for mksurfdata.pl and 
the build-namelist unit tester.

In order to calculate infiltration the fraction of ground covered in surface water is used, before it is updated
to account for snow. Also mulitply k_wet by a factor of 1x10^-4 both of these will makes a difference in surface runoff.
This change is essentially a bug in the original formulation and so we've applied to both CLM45 and CLM50 answers.
Since this is hydrology it will affect answers in all CLM45/CLM%0 cases whether SP, CN or BGC modes.

For MEGAN we were using a new updated dataset that had the addition of all 78 PFT's including the new crop ones.
Unfortunately it also had bare-soil, and this moved the indexing off by one. So we have a new dataset that removes
the bare-soil and hence works correctly now.

A simple addition of setting lake energy flux (eflx_grnd_lake) for the case when there isn't one layer os snow.

For CLM45 we found that the use of the Zheng rooting profile for Carbon resulted in 1850 spinup simulations that couldn't
spinup the tropics. Using the Jackson-1996 profile alleviates this problem.

There were also some simple problems in using the queryNamelistDefaults.pl tool with the new cime tag brought in
with clm4_5_12_r202. Fixing this allows mksurfdata.pl and build-namelist-unit_tester to work.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
    2378 Zheng profile for carbon results in tropics that doesn't spin up
    2376 mksurfdata tests fail in clm4_5_12_r202 with new cime version
    2375 84 tests are removed from build-namelist unit_tester 
    2374 Use fraction of ground covered in surface water used in infiltration before it's updated to account for snow

One-line Summary: Bug fixes for snow-on-lake

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fix a few bugs with the calculation of melt fluxes arising from
snow-on-lake. These appear to mainly just affect diagnostic terms, although in
theory it looks like this fixes a possible balance check error in rare
conditions.

Changes are from Leo van Kampenhout (l.vankampenhout@uu.nl)

Specific changes are:

(1) qflx_sl_top_soil is no longer updated in LakeHydrology. Terms that used to
    go into that variable now go into qflx_snow_drain.

(2) For the case where we have snow above an unfrozen lake: Changed calculation
    of qflx_snomelt and eflx_snomelt:

Old:
               qflx_snomelt(c) = qflx_snomelt(c) + h2osno(c)/dtime
               eflx_snomelt(c) = eflx_snomelt(c) + h2osno(c)*hfus/dtime 

New:
               qflx_snomelt(c) = qflx_snomelt(c) + sumsnowice(c)/dtime
               eflx_snomelt(c) = eflx_snomelt(c) + sumsnowice(c)*hfus/dtime 

So note that this now just considers sumsnowice rather than the full h2osno -
i.e., it doesn't remelt the liquid in the snow pack.

(3) For the case where we have snow above an unfrozen lake: The update of
    qflx_snow_drain is changed; and again, note that qflx_sl_top_soil is gone.

Old:
               ! update drainage from snow pack for this case
               qflx_snow_drain(c)     = qflx_snow_drain(c)  + qflx_snomelt(c)
               qflx_sl_top_soil(c) = qflx_sl_top_soil(c) + h2osno(c)

New:
               ! update incidental drainage from snow pack for this case
               qflx_snow_drain(c) = qflx_snow_drain(c) + h2osno(c)/dtime

The old version had three apparent problems:

(a) This drainage term contributed to both qflx_snow_drain and qflx_sl_top_soil,
    which later get added together (in BalanceCheck); as noted in (1), the uses
    of qflx_sl_top_soil and qflx_snow_drain have been merged into just
    qflx_snow_drain in this routine.

(b) The qflx_sl_top_soil addition adds h2osno, without dividing by dtime

(c) The qflx_snow_drain addition adds the full qflx_snomelt, which may include
    other terms that were set prior to this code.

Note that, in the new version, we want to drain the *whole* snow pack in this
case - liquid as well as solid.

(4) qflx_top_soil is changed:

Old:
         qflx_top_soil(c)  = qflx_prec_grnd_rain(p) + qflx_snomelt(c)

New:
         qflx_top_soil(c)  = qflx_prec_grnd_rain(p) + qflx_snow_drain(c)

What the soil receives should equal what leaves the snow, i.e. the drainage term.

One-line Summary: Rework initialization of transient weights - important with use_init_interp

Purpose of changes
------------------

Two main purposes:

(1) When using use_init_interp in a case with CISM, avoid doing dyn landcover
    adjustments in the first time step after initialization. This is important
    in order to avoid fictitious adjustments simply due to the fact that we
    don't have updated glacier areas until the run loop (as in the cold start
    case).

(2) Update prescribed transient weights (for PFTs and crops) in initialization,
    rather than weighting for the run loop. This undoes part of
    clm4_5_1_r101. This can be important if you're running use_init_interp, so
    that the appropriate points are active on the output dataset.

More details on (1): This was achieved by initializing glacier areas at the
start of the run loop for cold start or interpolated start.

Rationale:

In the first time step of a run that used cold start or init_interp, glacier
areas will start at whatever is specified on the surface dataset, because
coupling fields from GLC aren't received until the run loop. Thus, CLM will see
a potentially large, fictitious glacier area change in the first time step after
cold start or init_interp. We don't want this fictitious area change to result
in any state or flux adjustments. Thus, we apply this area change at the start
of the driver loop, so that in dynSubgrid_driver, it will look like there is no
glacier area change in the first time step.

This needs to happen very early in the run loop, before any balance checks are
initialized, because - by design - this doesn't conserve mass at the grid cell
level. (The whole point of this new code block in the driver is that we adjust
areas without doing the typical state or flux adjustments that need to accompany
those area changes for conservation.)

This accomplishes approximately the same effect that we would get if we were
able to update glacier areas in initialization. The one difference - and minor,
theoretical problem - that could arise from this start-of-run-loop update is: If
the first time step of the CESM run loop looked like: (1) GLC runs and updates
glacier area (i.e., glacier area changes in the first time step compared with
what was set in initialization); (2) coupler passes new glacier area to CLM; (3)
CLM runs. Then the code here would mean that the true change in glacier area
between initialization and the first time step would be ignored as far as state
and flux adjustments are concerned. But this is unlikely to be an issue in
practice: Currently GLC doesn't update this frequently, and even if it did, the
change in glacier area in a single time step would typically be very small.

If we are ever able to change the CESM initialization sequence so that GLC
fields are passed to CLM in initialization, then this new code block in the
driver can be removed.


Also: Remove handling of first step since cold start in dynSubgrid_driver. This
is no longer needed now that (a) we update prescribed transient weights in
initialization, and (b) we have special-purpose code for glacier in the main
driver run loop.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_12_r200


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM50 with CISM, with use_init_interp = .true.
      ALSO: Possible answer changes in other transient configurations - see note below
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      not investigated carefully; could have climate changing impacts in a coupled run

   Baseline comparisons failed for the following three tests, as expected:
   FAIL ERS_D_Ld3.f09_g16_gl4.IG1850CRUCLM50BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-clm50KitchenSink COMPARE_baseline

   FAIL SMS_Lm1.f09_g16_gl4.IG1850CRUCLM50BGC.yellowstone_intel.clm-clm50KitchenSink COMPARE_baseline

   In addition, it's possible that answer changes would appear in a coupled,
   transient run with cold start or init_interp, due to changes in the fields
   sent in initialization (or the first time step???)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: Latest parameter updates from simulations, ignore surface soil layer for plant hydraulic stress for greater variability in surface soil moisture

Purpose of changes
------------------

Ignore surface soil layer for plant hydraulic stress which allows for greater variability in surface soil
moisture. Output some additional diagnostic fields to the history files. Rename fertnitro to manunitro,
both in code and in params files. Add options to vary baset by latitude for tropical crops and subtract
crop seed carbon. Don't call precision control for frootc for CLM50.

For CLM50 we bring in the latest set of parameter updates to the parameter file as well as namelist items.
Many of these were manually tuned, and many were tuned with the automatic calibration process of Rosie Fisher
and Ben Sanderson.

Fix several bugs, a couple possible divide by zero errors, only run freelivingfixation when FUN on. Limit
array operation by number of layers. Add option to put list of namelist parameters to an output file.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
  bug 2349 Run freelivingfixation only if FUN is on
  bug 2362 Possible divide by zero for fert when fertilizer off
  bug 2364 maxval check goes over whole range of array when should just go to nlayers
  bug 2366 fix divide by zero in Luna
  bug 2367 Add a list of real parameters as part of what CLM build-namelist does (partial)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID): [If none, remove this line]
  bug 2368 Remove old "use_voc" logic that was put in as a hack to turn off megan when prognostic crop was on
           (This existed before, but we just spotted it as a problem)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): None

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
    New namelist items: baset_mapping, baset_latvary_slope, baset_latvary_intercept, 
                  initial_seed_at_planting
    new clm namelists: cnphenology, crop
    New history fields: LNC, BTRANMN, CPHASE, LATBASET, CROPSEEDC all default active

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   New parameter calibrations
   For CLM50:
              baseflow_scalar=0.0090932, zetamaxstable=0.5, pot_hmn_ign_counts_alpha=0.0079611
              Jmaxb1=0.093563, initial_seed_at_planting=3.0, decomp_depth_efolding=10.0
              baset_mapping=varytropicsbylat, baset_latvary_intercept=12, baset_latvary_slope=0.4
              br_root=1.1678d-06, initial_Cstocks=3*200.0
   For CLM45 old defaults used:

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
   New parameter dataset with latest calibration changing following fields:
      mergetoclmpft modified to remove generic crops and merge to more existing crops
      mxmat,arooti,lfemerg,min_planting_temp,bfact,fleafi,manunitro manually calibrated by Yaqiong Lu for crop
      soilpsi_off,soilpsi_on manually calibrated

           modified by automatic calibration scripts
      maxpsi_hr hand calibrated by Charlie Koven
      i_vcad,s_vcad hand calibrated for crop
      FUN_fracfixers,dsladlai,ekn_active,froot_leaf,kmax,krmax,leaf_long,leafcn,mbbopt,psi50,slatop hand calibrated
      akn_active,croot_stem,ekc_active,kc_nonmyc,kn_nonmyc modified slightly
      leafcn,slato from TRY database

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   crop phase should be changed into integer with parameter indices for the different types
   as well as outputting flag_meanings and flag_values attributes. Remove LATBASET from history
   as constant.

   There is some complication for clm4_5 to preserve answers for latbarybaset
   and subtract_cropseed for fert that should be removed. Will change answers
   but shouldn't matter.

One-line Summary: Use CISM2 by default

Purpose of changes
------------------

For compsets that use CISM (IG compsets), use CISM2 by default.

Also update CISM external to a version with an updated input file for CISM2 at 4
km resolution.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Meaning of IG compset aliases changes - now means CISM2 rather than CISM1
- This results in slightly changed glacier cover over Greenland
- If you have a restart file from an old IG case (CLM45/CLM50) and plug it into
  an IG case with the same compset alias in this tag, there will be an initial
  shock to the system as CLM responds to the new glacier area. Thus, this change
  should be made in an offline run, and run for a year or more before plugging
  the new restart file into a coupled run.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- All IG tests will BFAIL because they use a new resolution

Changes to tests or testing:
- Removed the ICLM45GLCMEC compset that had been used for testing; replaced its
  test with IGCLM45BGC
- Added an ERP IG test, replacing the old PEM IG test

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Out-of-the-box IG compsets change answers due to
      the new definition of these compsets (CISM2 rather than CISM1)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Not investigated closely; expected to be larger than roundoff/same climate
      for most applications

      Also note that, for the sake of testing, IG tests will BFAIL

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Rework mapping of irrigation from CLM to ROF

Purpose of changes
------------------

The combination of the CLM changes and the changes to externals (RTM, MOSART,
CIME) change the way irrigation is mapped from CLM to ROF: Rather than being
mapped like other fluxes, it is mapped with normalization by VOLR. This means
that, if there are multiple ROF cells underlying a single CLM cell, then
irrigation with be withdrawn from each in an amount proportional to the VOLR in
each. So, for example, if a CLM cell overlaps two ROF cells, one with VOLR = 100
and one with VOLR = 200, then twice as much water will be withdrawn from the
second as from the first.

The main motivation for this change is to decrease the frequency at which
irrigation exceeds available river volume in a given ROF cell. This will
especially be improved once the volr-limited irrigation is working (this will be
fixed in an upcoming tag).


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- If this CLM tag is plugged in to a CESM tag, note that it depends on
  rtm1_0_59, mosart1_0_19, and the cime changes from
  https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/681

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added some irrigation tests
- Removed some tests from the xfail list which are now passing

Code reviewed by: Bill Sacks
  Note that most changes are originally from Sean Swenson; Bill Sacks reviewed
  and tested the changes

CLM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - not run

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - pass

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    yellowstone - not run

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45):

    yellowstone_intel - ok
    yellowstone_pgi - ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - ok
    hobart_nag - ok

    ok means tests pass; some baseline comparison failures as noted below;
    also, many IG tests (i.e., with CISM) showed baseline comparison failures,
    but this is simply because, with the new CISM external, CISM now does not
    produce a history file in short tests, whereas it did before.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_12_r197
Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: clm45/clm50 with irrigation, and all tests with MOSART
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
        not investigated carefully, but expected to be larger than roundoff/same
        climate

    Irrigation changes are due to the new mapping

    MOSART changes are just in x2l_Flrr_volr, r2x_Flrr_vol,r TWS & VOLR - due to
    a fixed calculation of VOLR in the MOSART external

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Bring new cime5 to clm trunk

Purpose of changes
------------------

   Update from cime4 version to cime5.1.1. This has some changes to the user interface
   on setting up cases. create_newcase largely works the same, but other scripts have
   subtle to more extensive changes to them. cime5 has scripts all done in object oriented Python. 

  create_newcase changes some options to use double "--" signs. Standard options
  can be done with either one or two.
  --user-compset        If set, then the --compset argument is treated as a
                        user specified compset.This assumes that all of the
                        compset settings in thecompset along name have been
                        defined for all of its componentsIf the compset name
                        is found as a supported compset, then it will be
                        treated as such.
  --pesfile PESFILE     Only used and required for --user-compset
                        argument.Full pathname of the pes specification
                        fileThis argument is required if --user-compset is
                        True
  --user-grid           If set, then the -grid argument is treated as a user
                        specified grid.As such, the additional argument
                        --gridfile must also be specifiedand all of the grid
                        settings in the --res argument name (which must be a
                        grid longnamehave been defined in the grid file
                        pointed to by --gridfile
  --gridfile GRIDFILE   Full pathname of config grid file to useThis should be
                        a copy of cime_config/config_grids.xmlwith the new
                        user grid changes added to itThis argument is required
                        if --user-grid is True

  create_newcase adds the following new options (
  --ninst NINST         Specify number of component instancesSet the number of
                        component instances in the case.
  --srcroot SRCROOT     Alternative path for source root directory. By default
                        this is set to cimeroot/../
  --walltime WALLTIME   Set the wallclock limit for this case. Can use env var
                        CIME_GLOBAL_WALLTIME to set this.
  -q QUEUE, --queue QUEUE
                        Force batch system to use a certain queue

  New files created in your case:

   Several files are softlinked into the case directory (such as case.setup, case.run, etc.)
   software_environment.txt -- your environment variables
   PESetupHist --- Directory for processor history changes

   case.clean_build is removed, and you use the --clean option to case.build

   xmlchange adds several options such as -subgroup
   xmlquery operation is a bit different. list capability is done via --list-all option.

   Format of *.xml files in your case is a bit different than before

  PIO versions were updated and PIO now catches some errors that it let go before.

  userdefinedmachine is upgraded so that you create a ~/.cime directory and put config_machines.xml
  for your machine (as well as config_compilers.xml, config_batch.xml, and config_build.xml
  if needed)

One-line Summary: Remove dependence on column weights in fire code

Purpose of changes
------------------

When calculating the fractions of BET and BDT, calculate these as fractions of
the column rather than as fractions of the grid cell. This is needed for
consistency with all other code in CLM, where the behavior of a column shouldn't
depend on that column's weight on the grid cell. The earlier code was
problematic in this way: If you did two runs - one with default areas, and one
where the natural veg landunit area was larger or smaller - then the evolution
of the natural veg landunit could change; this is not supposed to happen in CLM.

This can change answers for the fire code, but should generally only change
answers by a small amount, unless there are tropical grid cells where the
natural vegetation fraction is substantially less than 1.

Fang Li is okay with this change. She points out that the original formulation
was based on the fact that literataure typically cites 60% of (BET+BDT) on the
grid cell as a cutoff for being classified as tropical closed forest for the
sake of fire determinations, so the earlier code was consistent with that
definition. She also points out that this change could lead to a slightly
greater prevalence of deforestation fires and (after tuning) a consequently
smaller prevalence of non-deforestation fires - which can be undesirable. But
overall she is okay with this change given its likely small impact.

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CN/BGC with CLM45/CLM50
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Greater than roundoff for at least some tests; from some spot-checks,
      seems to be same climate.

      I have spot-checked a few tests that have greater than roundoff-level
      diffs (ERP_D_Ld5.f19_g16.IRCP85CLM45BGC.yellowstone_pgi.clm-drydepnomegan
      and ERI_D_Ld9.f09_g16.ICLM45BGC.yellowstone_intel.clm-default). These
      tests have diffs in just a few grid cells in the tropics.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Dribble annual dyn landunit adjustment fluxes; initialize water state for new crop columns

Purpose of changes
------------------

Two main changes in this tag:

(1) Add infrastructure for dribbling fluxes that are generated once per year (on
    the first time step of the year), so that an equal flux is produced
    throughout the year. Apply this infrastructure to the correction fluxes that
    are generated to conserve water and energy with dynamic columns / landunits.

(2) When a new column comes into existence (currently, this means a new crop
    column), copy h2osoi_liq, h2osoi_ice and h2osoi_vol from the "template"
    column (typically a natural veg column on that gridcell), in addition to the
    pre-existing copy of t_soisno.

Also, a minor change that touched many files: Replace inline uses of __FILE__
with a constant ('sourcefile') defined in each source file where this is
used. This is needed because lines with __FILE__ were sometimes exceeding pgi's
line limit (since pgi enforces the line limit after expanding macros). (See bugz
2049.)


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 2049 - __FILE__ expands to be too long sometimes

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- New uses of __FILE__ on outstanding branches should be replaced with
  sourcefile. Note that I have only added 'sourcefile' in files that currently
  needed it; other files may need to have this added.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added this test in order to test mid-year restarts with dynamic landunits
  (needed to test restartability of annual flux dribbling):
  ERS_D_Ld7.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHISTCLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-decStart1851_noinitial

  Note that the "noinitial" aspect of this can be removed once ignore_ic_date is
  made compatible with crop.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_12_r193


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: clm45/clm50 transient (HIST, RCP, DV or IG)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Not investigated carefully, but expected to be new climate for
      configurations that have transient column areas (IG or transient crop,
      which involve large transitions at the starat of the year), but only
      marginally different (approx. roundoff-level) for transient natural PFTs
      (which involve gradual transitions throughout the year).

      I have verified that the answer changes due to the new annual flux
      dribbler infrastructure are reduced to 0 (i.e., bit-for-bit) if the flux
      on the first time step of the year is treated as before - i.e., other than
      the dribbling that is applied to this start-of-year flux, this
      infrastructure is bit-for-bit with the earlier code in dynConsBiogeophys.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: ED bugfixes and initial refactoring for a standalone library

Purpose of changes
------------------

NGEE-T development work on ED. Numerous science and software
improvements including:

* carbon linkages between ed and subsurface soil biogeochemistry
* improvements to patch fusion
* litter flux outputs
* phenology is self contained
* sites now align to clm columns
* ed is now a bgc mode
* check for incompatible physics
* better error checking of compatible name list options
* fixed memory corruption during restarts
* bit for bit restart for single point and global simulations works
* numerous threading related issues fixed
* numerous improvements to history and diagnostics

Start renaming some routines and modules to use the new name "FATES".

Initial development work to isolate ED from CLM and create a
standalone library, including:

* start defining an API for external drivers to interact with fates.
* start moving interaction between clm and fates into interface routines
* start work on thread safe fates objects
* data structures to clearly identify and isolate input and output
boundary conditions for some fates routines.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):

BalanceCheckMod.F90 was changed to loosen tolerances, not call endrun
if error in energy balance. This change isn't changing answers in
tests and wasn't caught until late in merging. It should probably be
reverted.

ED is not thread safe, and is not expected to work or restart with
multiple threads.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist
variables): ed is now a bgc mode.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
updated ed parameters file.

Substantial timing or memory changes: unknown

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:

Code reviewed by: Ryan Knox, Charlie Koven, Rosie Fisher

One-line Summary: New parameterizations for snow overburden compaction and wind drift compaction

Purpose of changes
------------------

   Introduces new parameterizations for snow overburden compaction and wind
   drift compaction. By default, CLM45 uses the old snow overburden compaction
   formula and no wind drift compaction, whereas CLM5 uses the new
   parameterizations.

   Also changes the CLM50 default for the snow compaction parameter
   upplim_destruct_metamorph

   Scientific changes are from Leo van Kampenhout (l.vankampenhout@uu.nl)


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   New namelist option: snow_overburden_compaction_method

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   - Changed clm5_0 default for upplim_destruct_metamorph
   - upplim_destruct_metamorph appears in namelist for clm4_5 as well as clm5_0
   - upplim_destruct_metamorph default changed for clm5_0 (175 rather than 150)
   - overburden_compress_tfactor appears in namelist for clm4_5; does not appear
     when using the new Vionnet2012 snow overburden compaction method (so does
     not appear by default with clm5_0); no longer has a different default value
     for clm5_0 (since it doesn't appear by default in clm5_0)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

   The new parameterizations are more complex, so have a moderate (~ 20%) impact
   on SnowCompaction timing, but this is a very small part of the overall CLM
   run time. The timing impacts of extracting routines to compute some of
   the snow compaction terms were minimal (only increased the SnowCompaction
   time by a few percent).

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing: none

Code reviewed by: self; Dave Lawrence also reviewed Leo's initial implementation

CLM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - ok

      tests pass; differences from baseline for CLM45 and CLM50 as expected

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - pass

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    yellowstone - not run

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

     yellowstone - not run

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45):

    yellowstone_intel - ok
    yellowstone_pgi - ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - ok
    hobart_nag - ok

    ok means tests pass (or xfail); differences from baseline for CLM50 as expected

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_12_r190


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM50
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Larger than roundoff; I haven't investigated this closely, but suspect
      these changes result in new climate, at least regionally

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new

One-line Summary: Fix snow capping bug

Purpose of changes
------------------

   When snow capping was triggered, the bottom snow layer was decreased in mass,
   but dz remained unchanged, leading to problematic changes in density. This
   tag fixes that problem, so that dz is decreased appropriately.

   These changes are from Leo van Kampenhout (l.vankampenhout@uu.nl)

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: potentially all clm45 / clm50
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Larger than roundoff. I have not investigated the size of the change,
      suspect it is the same climate with respect to land-atmosphere fluxes, but
      potentially different climate with respect to snow pack properties and SMB
      sent to CISM. (This changes the density of the bottom layer of deep snow
      packs.)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? n/a

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: Bring in time varying streams for urban data (currently triggers AC use)

Purpose of changes
------------------

Instead of reading in maximum building temperature from surface dataset, read it in from
a time-varying urban streams file. This allows the urban Air Conditioning use to change
in time as well as spatially. Other spatially and temporally changing parameters can be added
(or moved from the surface dataset) to this stream file as well in the future. The new streams
file has the same kind of controls as other streams file for years to run over, filename, and
mapping algorithm. The time interpolation is assumed to be linear, and it uses taxmode=extend
so it will use the first value before the first year and the last value after the last year.
The current dataset is at one degree resolution (f09_g16). Because of this CLM45 compsets
will change answers to some extent (because interpolation methods for streams are slightly
different) -- but answers will be very similar. CLM50 compsets will change because there is
variation in the max building temperature both spatially and temporally.

Also fix a problem with the humanstress module for GSWP3 forcing because of temperatures that
are too high for the WetBulb method to converge. WetBulb previously only allowed two iterations
and now it allows more (10,000). If the method fails to converge it will exit with a warning.
This was worked on by Jonathan Buzan with Keith Oleson.

   2348 PTCLMmkdata not able to run for clm5_0
   2305 Nan for wet bulb temperature

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons:  clm4_5_11_r188


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: Yes!

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: clm4_5 (to a minor degree) and clm5_0 with urban
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: same climate

  CLM45 answers with urban areas may change to a minor degree because of the use of
  the urban time varying stream file to get the max indoor building temperature rather
  than reading from the surface dataset. Shorter tests are fairly close and some may be
  identical (all CLM45 single point cases are identical). Tests of a month or longer likely
  diverge.

  Five of the 22 CLM45 and CLM45BGC tests with f10_f10 on hobart are different, others are the same.
  Half of the 46 CLM45 CLM45 tests with f10_f10 on yellowstone are the same.

One-line Summary: A set of small answer changing issues for both clm45 and clm50

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes to CLM45 and CLM50:

Some adjustments to methane output (for both CLM45BGC) and CLM50BGC from Xiyan Xu. This calculates 
finundated from before snow, and rather than multiplying m_tiller by LAI it multiples by a constant four.

Update Li2014 FireFluxes subroutine for spinupstate=2 capability (so can be shared). Changes to
roundoff, while also allowing spinupstate==2 and fixing bug 2243 to deal with deadstem for CLM45 
from Charlie Koven.

Carbon and Nitrogen state missing accounting of of live to dead from fire in StateUpdate3.

Nitrogen uptake code error from Xiaojuan Yang and Charlie Koven. This is dependent on use_nitrif_denitrif=T
so will only affect CLM45BGC/CLM50BGC, but not SP or CN alone simualtions. This is for the 2nd pass at 
Nitrogen uptake.

Issue with carbon Isotopes. Brett Raczka and Henrique Duarte at Univ. Utah have identified a bug in the 
CLM4.5 C isotope code, in which isotope ratios are not stabilizing when fire turns on.  Turning off the 
fire code produces reasonable isotope ratios.  We've identified that the problem is that the variables 
for the fire fluxes associated with the new fire code were never copied over into CNCIsoFluxMod.F90. Fix
from Charlie Koven, and Brett verified it worked in his version. Also update the C14 half-life value. Used
to be the Libbey value, now use the updated one.

Changes to CLM50 only:

Remove discontiniues in new CLM50 snow density. Also if wind is zero (< 0.1m/s), wind_dependent_snowdensity
is increase is also zero. Some changes to fire injection height for fire-emissions from Simone Tilmes, and a unit-conversion
error fix from Fang Li.

Summary:

ciso errors bug 2116 (isotopes both clm45/clm5)
Bug 2224 N uptake code clm45/clm50BGC
Transfer of live to dead bug 2264 clm45/clm5)
2326 for shade part clm5
snow density discontinuities (2328) clm5
Methane change on mechanges branch clm45/clm5 2338
2340 Fire emission change from Simone clm5
Units conversion error in CNfire-emissions bug 2342 clm5

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

2116  C isotope (13C and 14C) errors in fire code
2141  Precision of constants in SoilTemperature.F90 is not double
2224  plant N uptake second pass error 
2243  Deadstem not taken into account in fire-fluxes for clm4_5 (koven) (FOR CLM45 SIDE)
2264  Fire is missing accounting of C/N for transfer of live to dead
2326  Bad multiplication of btran for soybean or nbrdlf_dcd_tmp_shrub with CNDV in CanopyFluxes
2328  Discontinuities in new CLM50 snow density formulation
2338  Use the pre-snow values to calculate finundated, and use constant for m_tiller rather than elai
2340  Adjustments to fire-emission from Simone Tilmes

One-line Summary: Some CLM45/50 changes: seperate carbon and water root profile, turn off undercanopystability, 
                  really turn PHS on, LUNA predict sunlit fraction N fractionation

Purpose of changes
------------------

   Seperate the carbon and water fine root profiles and have namelist control over them. This removes the duplicated
   code in soilbiogeochem that replicated the Jackson-1996 profile. Also remove several soilbiogeochem specific namelist
   control items over the root profile.

   CLM50 changes: 
        Change water fine root profile to Jackson-1996 with rootprof_beta adjusted for water (dlawren)
        Turn off under canopy stability term that decreases csoilc by Sakaguchi&Zeng, 2008 (swensosc)
        When fun on -- add cpool_to_leafc to leafc_to_litter and cpool_to_frootc to frootc_to_litter (rfisher)
        Really turn Plant Hydrallic Stress on (erik)
        Have LUNA predict the scaling of Vcmax/Jmax/tpu-25 for canopy sunlight/shaded average in Photosynthesis (rfisher)

   CLM45 changes:  Water fine root profile was used rather than carbon profile (used in soilbiogeochem) in CNMResp and in ch4Mod
     The profile used was zeng_2001, it's now Jackson_1996. You can duplicate the old answers if you use zeng-2001 for CNMResp
     and ch4Mod, but Jackson-1996 for soilbiogeochem.

             rooting_profile_varindex_carbon, and use_undercanopy_stability
        Remove: pftspecific_rootingprofile, exponential_rooting_profile, and rootprof_exp

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
        set: rooting_profile_method_carbon = Jackson1996 (both clm50 and clm45)
             rooting_profile_method_water  = Zeng_2001 (clm45), Jackson1996 (clm50)
             use_undercanopy_stability     = .true. (clm45),   .false. (clm50)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
   New params files (with 2D rootprof_beta)

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

One-line Summary: Initialize biogeochem balance checks AFTER column area updates

Purpose of changes
------------------

Reworking the conservation of patch-level CN variables with dynamic landunits
will make the column-level CN balance checks very tricky to determine, as they
were written before - where the starting point for the comparison was determined
before all of the area adjustments (i.e., the dyn subgrid stuff). This becomes
much more straightforward if the initialization of the balance checks is done
after the dyn subgrid stuff is complete. This tag makes that change.

In order to accomplish that, we need to re-compute the CN state summaries after
the dyn subgrid stuff is complete - near the beginning of the time step. We
still need the summary routine at the end of the time step for the sake of
diagnostics (e.g., history output). So now we call the summary routines twice
for states. We do NOT need to call the flux summary routines at the beginning of
the time step - and doing so doesn't really make sense (how do you summarize
fluxes that haven't yet been computed) - so I have split the top-level summary
routine into a SummarizeStates and SummarizeFluxes.

I also reworked the ch4 balance check similarly, in order to be consistent with
the CN balance checks.

Longer-term, we'll add another set of balance checks that operate on
gridcell-level quantities, which WILL cover the dyn subgrid stuff. So the
overall sequence will look like:

   Initialize gridcell-level balance checks
   Dyn subgrid stuff (adjust patch, column, landunit areas, and do associated
      state updates)
   Initialize column-level balance checks
   Science routines
   Check column-level balance
   Check gridcell-level balance

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM50 runs with BGC that involve changes
      in subgrid areas (including HIST, RCP, DV and IG cases)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Not investigated closely; expected to be larger than roundoff / same climate

      Answer changes come from the fact that some code (e.g., the fire code)
      uses the summarized state variables. Previously, this code was using the
      state summaries from the previous time step. With this change, the code is
      now using the updated state summaries. These updated state summaries can
      differ from the ones computed at the end of the last time step if subgrid
      areas have changed.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Revert glacial melt behavior to the old treatment for mountain glaciers

Purpose of changes
------------------

The primary change in this tag is reverting glacial melt behavior to the old
scheme (i.e., the scheme used in standard glacier landunits) for mountain
glaciers: The old scheme involves glacial melt remaining in place until it
refreezes (thus, not generating any runoff), whereas the new scheme involves
glacial melt running off and being replaced by ice from below (generating
positive liquid runoff and negative ice runoff).

The main motivation for this change is that mountain glaciers were generating
substantial negative ice runoff in coupled cases when using the new scheme. This
is presumably because CAM's topographic height is significantly lower than the
real-world topographic height in mountainous regions, so mountain glaciers were
seeing too-warm temperatures. The LIWG, in consultation with members of the
LMWG, decided to revert mountain glaciers to their old behavior to avoid
detrimentally impacting a coupled simulation. Because the LIWG is not currently
concerned with the SMB of mountain glaciers - and because mountain glacier SMB
cannot be realistically simulated yet anyway - this reversion was not considered
a problem from their perspective.

To accomplish this, this tag introduces a new namelist variable,
glacier_region_melt_behavior. Like glacier_region_behavior, this keys off of the
GLACIER_REGION field on the surface dataset. Thus, different melt behavior can
be used for each glacier region. By default, Greenland and Antarctica use the
new (glc_mec) behavior ('replaced_by_ice'), whereas other regions use the old
behavior ('remains_in_place').

For glacier columns that use the 'remains_in_place' melt behavior, we do NOT
compute surface mass balance (SMB). This is because the negative component of
SMB is non-sensical in those columns. To make this clear, the QICE, QICE_FRZ and
QICE_MELT diagnostic fields are filled with missing values in the
'remains_in_place' region. (However, the qice fields sent to the coupler, along
with QICE_FORC, are 0 in that region - giving the values that are actually sent
to the coupler.)

Note that this means that different glacier regions now have different
physics. And, in order to compute SMB, you would need to change the melt
behavior, thus significantly changing the behavior of mountain glaciers.

This tag also refactors the code that computes glacier surface mass balance so
that this is centralized in one module: GlacierSurfaceMassBalanceMod.F90.

Other behavior changes in this tag are:

(1) The subgrid snow parameterization (subgrid topographic variability) now
    differentiates between 'single_at_atm_topo' istice_mec columns and other
    istice_mec columns. Previously, istice_mec columns were treated differently
    from others because they already have some representation of subgrid
    variability. However, 'single_at_atm_topo' columns should be treated more
    like other columns, because they do not allow for this elevation class
    variability; this has been fixed here.

(2) Vegetated SMB is computed for all grid cells where we compute glacier
    SMB. Previously vegetated SMB was only generated in the 'virtual' glacier
    region, but that added complexity to the code logic without having a good
    reason (as far as I can tell). This change just affects the lnd -> glc
    fields for elevation class 0 (changing where these are valid, rather than
    being set to 0): it does not affect the evolution of CLM.

(3) Adds some error checking for the glacier_region_behavior namelist item as
    well as for the new glacier_region_melt_behavior namelist item.

Between the primary change in this tag and the change in (1), it is now possible
to make the evolution of glacier_mec landunits exactly match the evolution of
standard glacier landunits - by using a glacier_region_behavior of
'single_at_atm_topo' and a glacier_region_melt_behavior of 'remains_in_place'.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Surface mass balance (SMB) is no longer computed for mountain glaciers. In
  order to compute SMB, you would need to change the
  glacier_region_melt_behavior, which will change behavior significantly for
  mountain glaciers.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variable, glacier_region_melt_behavior - as described above. This
  variable and glacier_region_behavior both appear in the default namelist for
  all clm45/clm50 cases, but only affect the operation of CLM if running with
  glc_mec (i.e., a case with CISM).

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

In addition, ran 100-year runs to confirm that glc_mec (istice_mec) landunits
can now be made to operate exactly the same as standard glacier (istice) with
the appropriate namelist settings:

  IG run: 1850_DATM%QIA_CLM50%BGC_SICE_SOCN_RTM_CISM1_SWAV

      glacier_region_melt_behavior = 'remains_in_place','remains_in_place','remains_in_place'

  and with the following sourceMods to allow running an IG compset with

  with setting initial glacier h2osno to 10000) to try to make sure we're
  exercising both glacier increases and decreases (though I didn't confirm that
  we're definitely exercising increases and decreases in those). Ran those hot &

One-line Summary: CLM50 changes: Atkin form of lmr changed, new parameters and files, turn PHS on by default, new 
                  cold snow density, reseed at exit AD spinup, fix fire bug, fix npool and cpool errors

Purpose of changes
------------------

The CLM50 Atkin method of leaf maintenence respiration was changed by Dr. Rosie Fisher according to communication with Atkin.
New parameter file for CLM50 with new parameters. Plant Hydraulic Stress is now on by default for CLM50. New formulation
for snow density below -15C from Dr. Andrew Slater and Dr. David Lawrence. If plants are dead at the exit AD spinup stage, reseed.
Fix a fire bug which allowed negative nitrogen pools. Fix some npool and cpool errors.

Work on CNFUNMod, correct indentation, and headers and comments. Remove unused arrays. Initialize arrays in filter loops. Do
some changes to increase performance. Make logic for CNPrecisionControl into three subroutines, when especially negative abort.

 -- Changes from Rosie Fisher to remove leaf_acc term, and implement changes to the Atkin form of lmr25top based on personal communication
with Atkin.
 -- new params file
 -- Read in PHS parameters from PFT params file.
 -- CNPrecisionControl modularization
 -- new method for snow density and a change to how wind_dependent_snow_density is done for clm5.0. upplim_destruct_metamorph and
 -- overburden_compress_tfactor for clm5
 -- Put mbbopt on params file and use it
 -- removed deciduous retranslocation adjustment to plant_ndemand to fix cpool error
 -- Checkin Keith's changes to reseed Carbon for forests if in spinup mode and returning to regular mode, this should help in making it so
 -- that you can always use spunup initial conditions rather than always having to do a cold start
 -- Some FUN optimization.
 -- Set barriers, ATM_PIO_TYPENAME
 -- removed deciduous retranslocation adjustment to plant_ndemand to fix cpool error
 -- If leafn small set leaf-CN and storage_leaf-CN to missing value in NutrientCompetitionFlexibleCNMod
 -- add in free N flux direct to npool
 -- Move update of grainn_to_food side by side to grainc_to_food with the same equation, from Rosie and Keith (bug 2327)
 -- fire (bug 2314)
 -- soybean CNDV shrub (bug 2326)

One-line Summary: Decomposition is not water limited after reaching a field capacity parameter (maxpsi_hr) rather 
                  than only at soil saturation

Purpose of changes
------------------

Replaces the hard-coded assumption present in prior versions of the model that soil respiration was 
water-limited whenever it fell below saturation. Now it's no longer water-limited from maxpsi_hr up
to saturation.

This was due to a wrong interpretation/implementation of the following paper.

Andren, O., and K. Paustian, 1987. Barley straw decomposition in the field: a comparison of models. Ecology, 68(5):1190-1200

One-line Summary: Bring in option for plant hydraulic stress for clm50

Purpose of changes
------------------

Add in option for plant hydraulic stress (PHS). Does Leaf stomatal resistance and leaf photosynthesis
simultaneous solution of sunlit/shaded per Pierre Gentine/Daniel Kennedy PHS method. Vegetation
water potential is calculated for four conductance segments: sun, shade, xylem, and root. 

The main impact in the code is in CanopyFluxes where either the PHS or non-PHS version of Photosynthesis is
called and the sun and shade segments are solved simultaneously. Then it impacts soil water movement
for transpiration.

PHS is turned on by adding use_hydrstress=.true. in your user_nl_clm file for your case.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID): 2323 (duplication in Photosynthesis)


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users: use_dynroots and use_hydrstress can NOT both be on at the same time!

Changes to CLM's user interface: None

Changes made to namelist defaults: Add use_hydrstress=.false.

Changes to the datasets: None

Substantial timing or memory changes: Maybe 4% slower with PHS, memory only increases by 0.1MB

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers: PhotosynthesisMod is duplicated for PHS and non-PHS
    PhotosynthesisMod more than doubles in size from 2k to 4.5k. Most of it
    is duplicated. Thus changes to one part of the code, have to be duplicated
    in the other part, causing double maintence. Also the effects of 6 namelist
    control items are duplicated meaning those items have to be tested in both
    branches to ensure they are working correctly. (bug 2323)

Changes to tests or testing: Add use_hydrstress=T to KitchenSink tests
     add clm50dynroots test directory

One-line Summary: Update cime version which fixes several issues and changes answers

Purpose of changes
------------------

   Update for CIME: This includes several key important changes and bug-fixes
      - Now there is a CLMGSWP3 option for DATM_MODE
      - When running with datm driver has a barrier each day (so MP_EAGER_LIMIT is no longer needed)
      - PIO1 is now the default (PIO2 still exists as an option, but now both exist and you can choose which one)
      - Driver now merges CLM's drv_flds_in file with CAM's and aborts on a conflict
      - The drv_flds_in namelists are defined in the driver where the source exists
      - The drv_flds_in file is recreated just like other namelist files (no longer have to delete earlier one)
      - Changes answers because of shr_orb (see below)

   Changes to tools to include Caspian Sea as a CLM Lake on surface datasets

   Add LND_TUNING_MODE as an env_run.xml variable. The default setting is determined by which major physics
   version is being used (clm4_0, clm4_5, or clm5_0). We intend to use this in order to tune parameters
   for clm5_0 offline with GSWP3 forcing versus clm5_0 with CAM5.5.

   CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP="on" now cuts back I/O and is much faster (only outputs a few fields yearly). It
   also applies for both with and without CN. If CN is on, it will by default turn Accellerated Decomposition
   on.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
     2308 prebeta clm40 compsets are using the wrong testmods directories
     2307 MOSART assumes no-leap calendar
     2303 user_compset gives different settings than expected for options defined in config_compsets.xml
     2280 Need to set barriers for I compsets with PE layouts where datm runs concurrently to CLM
     2256 Problems with early versions of PIO2 in CLM
     2252 Changing megan_specifier for I cases doesn't actually change the megan_specifier in the resolved namelist
     1674 RTM assumes no-leap calendar

CIME Issues fixed (include issue #):
     #315 Add CLMGSWP3
     #324 Merge drv_flds_in in driver from different components
     #56 SSP test treats ref1 case as the main case

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID): cime issue #453 (ESMF tests fail)
   cime issue #455 (have to delete Macros file if switch to mpi-serial)


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users: CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP mean is different (see below)

Changes to CLM's user interface: Add LND_TUNING_MODE, CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP changed.

    LND_TUNING_MODE added in with defaults for each CLM physics option (clm4_0, clm4_5, and clm5_0)
    clm4_0 wasn't tuned for a specific forcing, clm4_5 was tuned for CRUNCEP forcing, clm5_0 is
    currently tuned for running with CAM5.5. We eventually expect to have tunings for clm5_0
    for running offline and also with CAM5.5.

    Also CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP is now changed and available whether CN is on or not. For a SP
    (Satelite Phenology) case this mode reduces output in order to speed up the simulation.
    For a CN case it does that as well as turning on spinup_state to an accelerated decomposition
    mode. If you don't want CN to be in accelerated decomposition set spinup_state=0 in your user_nl_clm
    (for final spinup after AD mode).

Changes made to namelist defaults: nsegspc is now 35 instead of 20

Changes to the datasets:  None

Changes for tools:
   Files for surface dataset creation now set Caspian sea as a Lake
   new maps for mksurfdata with Caspian Sea

Substantial timing or memory changes: The change in nsegspc should improve performance slightly
    Running with CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP="on" will make a good 20% improvement in performance
    from less history output and turning megan off

One-line Summary: Refactor dyn_cnbal_patch

Purpose of changes
------------------

There was a lot of duplicated code, as well as almost-but-not-quite-duplicated
code in dyn_cnbal_patch (the code used for updating patch-level BGC variables
when patch weights change). This tag consolidates this duplicated code into some
new shared infrastructure, similar to what is done for column-level variables.

In addition, do not zero states when patch weights go to zero. (I expected this
to change answers for 1-d history files, but it didn't.)

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 2317: incorrect handling of isotopes with transient PFTs starting in clm4_5_1_r097


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: small timing increase: about 10% increase

    Roundoff-level changes

    Greater than roundoff-level for transient runs with isotopes, due to fixing

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   Created a branch (dynlu_conserve_cn3_oneoff) that was as similar as possible
   to the trunk, with just those changes needed to get bit-for-bit behavior with
   my new code (e.g., reordering some calculations). Confirmed that my new code
   is bit-for-bit with that.

One-line Summary: Update column-level BGC state variables with dynamic landunits

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update column-level BGC state variables as column areas change due to dynamic
landunits. This does NOT yet update column-level biogeophysical variables, NOR
does it handle patch-level variables appropriately.

Note that some variables that used to only exist on vegetated landunits (soil &
crop landunits) now exist on all landunits. When columns in special landunits
expand, they take on the carbon, nitrogen and methane state variables from the
columns they expanded into. These C / N / CH4 quantities essentially get trapped
underneath the glacier (or lake / urban / whatever), staying fixed until that
column eventually shrinks. If that special column shrinks and is replaced by a
vegetated column, then the vegetated column takes on the state that had been
trapped under the glacier (or whatever). In this way, we avoid destroying or
creating mass when special landunits grow and shrink. This change explains why
summary variables that used to be computed for just soil & crop columns are now
computed for all columns.

Note: In some testing (particularly in the 6-year Smallville test case), I found
that there was a huge decrease (order of magnitude or more) in methane
concentrations in the unsaturated portion of the growing column after column
area adjustments. As far as I can tell, the state variable is being updated
correctly due to the changing column areas, but then within the timestep evolves
rapidly to a different value. From talking with Dave Lawrence, we assume this is
due to the adjustment of carbon content in the column, since the carbon state
can have a big effect on methane fluxes.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
- 2283: dynamic landunits: handle methane with changing lake area [enhancement]

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

   When using use_init_interp in cases with CISM (IG/JG/FG/BG) compsets, there
   is a large adjustment in Greenland glacier area in the first timestep of the
   run, even if glacier evolution is off. (This is because, in initialization,
   glacier area comes from CLM's surface dataset; then glacier area is updated
   to match CISM in the first timestep, even if glacier evolution is off.) This
   results in big adjustments in column-level carbon, nitrogen and methane
   content in the first timestep, because it looks to CLM like some glacier
   columns have grown significantly (trapping C / N / CH4), while others have
   shrunk significantly, causing a significant decrease in area-average C / N /
   CH4 in the growing vegetated columns.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_8_r178


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM50 with CN/BGC, either with CISM (IG)
      or transient crops (historical / RCP compsets with CROP)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      larger than roundoff; potentially new climate

   The evolution of C / N / CH4 state variables is now completely different with
   transient glacier or crop areas, causing significant answer changes.

   These transient crop tests change answers:
     ERS_Ly5_P60x1.f10_f10.IHISTCLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput
     SMS_D_Ly6.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHISTCLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_pgi.clm-cropMonthOutput
   
   For glacier, typically changes will only be seen if ice evolution is turned
   on, but changes will be seen even with ice evolution off - or ice evolution on
   in a test too short to actually see any ice evolution - if use_init_interp
   is used, as noted in the "caveats" section above. This affects these tests:
     ERS_D_Ld3.f09_g16_gl5.IG1850CRUCLM50BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-clm50KitchenSink
     SMS_Lm1.f09_g16_gl5.IG1850CRUCLM50BGC.yellowstone_intel.clm-clm50KitchenSink

   In addition, there are FILLDIFFs in a few methane variables. The new code
   seems correct, in that the fill pattern (over special landunits) is the same
   for all vertical levels: the old code had different fill patterns in lower
   soil layers. This affects these variables: CONC_O2_SAT, CONC_O2_UNSAT,
   CONC_CH4_SAT, CONC_CH4_UNSAT, LAYER_SAT_LAG.


   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

========= Update ch4 column-level state variables when column areas change. Also

          it's the first timestep where ch4 is included; (2) how variables that
          keep track of states in the previous timestep are set (this needed to
          be reworked to simplify what we need to adjust in the column
          conservation); (3) initializing conserved state variables to 0 (rather
          than spval) over special landunits (this required putting in place
          backwards compatibility with old restart files in subroutine Restart);
          (4) where start-of-timestep balance check initialization is done

One-line Summary: Remove some consistency checks, and merge crop_prog with use_crop in code

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Remove some consistency checks that were doing more harm than good:

    (a) Make init_interp_fill_missing_with_natveg unnecessary for natural veg
        and crop output points. This is mainly to support the common use case of
        interpolating from non-crop to crop, without requiring the user to set
        this flag.

    (b) Remove check_finidat_fsurdat_consistency - now never do this check. This
        consistency check was causing more problems than it solved, both for
        users and developers (e.g., requiring us to change initial conditions
        files whenever we made new versions of the surface dataset).

(2) Remove crop_prog logical variable from the code. This was identical to
    use_crop, and so it was confusing to have these two separate variables. Uses
    of crop_prog have been replaced by uses of use_crop.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- No longer need to set init_interp_fill_missing_with_natveg when interpolating
from non-crop to crop

One-line Summary: Move CN product pools to gridcell level

Purpose of changes
------------------

Move CN product pools from column-level to gridcell-level. This is needed for C
& N conservation with dynamic landunits, because there was no obvious way to
handle column-level product pools.

This also required moving some of the related fluxes to the gridcell-level.

Also added capability for init_interp to handle gridcell-level fields.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- If you run an old restart file through init_interp, product pools will be
  zeroed out. This is an issue for restart files that come from a transient run
  or from a clm5 crop run. Solution: run your old file through the new code for
  at least one time step without init_interp, then you can init_interp that
  file.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
- clmi.I2000CLM45CRUBGC.2000-01-01.0.9x1.25_gx1v6_simyr2000_c160127.nc replaced
  by clmi.I2000CLM45CRUBGC.2000-01-01.0.9x1.25_gx1v6_simyr2000_c160413.nc. This
  is basically the same, but run for one extra time step using compset ICLM45BGC
  with this branch.

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all CLM45/CLM5 with CN/BGC
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

    All CLM45/CLM5 CN/BGC cases have roundoff-level changes in product pools and
    related fluxes. In addition:

    (1) Bigger answer changes for CN/BGC cases using the f09 year-2000 initial
    conditions file: this file has been run through the new code for one
    additional time step. Differences were larger than I expected for this
    seemingly-minor change; I did not spend time tracking down the cause for
    those differences.

    (2) Cases doing interpolation (init_interp) from some other out-of-the-box
    initial conditions files have normalized RMS differences greater than
    roundoff. This is because some other initial conditions files (including
    some 1850 files) have non-zero product pools, which are zeroed out by
    init_interp: see the caveat for users above. However, in an absolute sense,
    RMS differences are small, because the product pools on these files are very
    small.

    (3) Greater than roundoff-level changes in product pools and related fluxes
    in transient crop cases. This shows up in the test
    ERS_Ly5_P60x1.f10_f10.IHISTCLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput. This
    is expected: in the old code, the product pools grew or shrank as the
    columns they were on grew or shrank. This was essentially the motivation for
    this tag.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

One-line Summary: Calculate active flags and filters earlier in initialization

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main purpose is to compute the active flags and filters (via reweight_wrapup)
earlier in initialization. These are now computed initially before the restart
file is read, and tehn updated as soon as possible in the midst of the restart
file read. This is useful in case any of the clm_instMod restart routines want
to use the active flags or filters, directly or indirectly (e.g., via a call to
subgridAveMod) - e.g., for the sake of backwards compatibility. This is
something that's needed in an upcoming tag.

Also: change some CN product history fields, so that they are more consistent -
so totals just give totals for wood:

- Renamed TOTPROD to TOT_WOODPROD

- Removed PRODUCT_CLOSS and similar fields, added TOT_WOODPRODC_LOSS and similar
  fields: now just include losses from wood product pools

One-line Summary: For glc_mec, change downscaling and where SMB is computed

Purpose of changes
------------------

Two main purposes:

(1) Change some aspects of the downscaling of atmospheric fields that is done
    when running with glc_mec. These change answers for glc_mec cases (i.e.,
    cases with CISM):

    (a) Change the downscaling equations for forc_th (potential temperature) and
    forc_rho (atmospheric density): Previously, these gave different answers
    from the gridcell value even if the column's topographic height exactly
    matched the atmosphere's topographic height. The new equations are based on
    deltas, ensuring that the downscaled values match the atmospheric forcings
    if topographic heights match.

    Now all downscaled fields should match the atmosphere forcings if the
    topographic heights match, *except* rain and snow (potentially large
    differences, by design), and longwave radiation (roundoff-level differences
    can be introduced by the normalization).

    (b) Perform downscaling over all column types inside the
    icemask. Previously, downscaling was done only for istice_mec and istsoil
    columns (because those were the only ones that computed SMB). I realized
    that this could result in some undesirable inconsistencies between the
    different columns in a gridcell, which could be especially problematic if a
    glacier advanced over (e.g.) a lake column. In practice, this seems to
    affect a few lake points inside Greenland.

    (c) Do *not* perform downscaling over glacier columns with the
    single_at_atm_topo behavior. This is for consistency with other column types
    whose topographic height (implicitly) matches the atmosphere's. In practice,
    this shouldn't effect the simulation much, if at all (due to the change in
    (a)).

    (d) Extracted a function to compute forc_rho, and pulled out some magic
    numbers from this calculation

(2) When running with glc_mec, compute SMB for all vegetated columns in the
    'virtual' glacier region, rather than just in the icemask. This affects the
    CLM fields sent to the coupler for elevation class 0, but otherwise has no
    direct effect on CLM evolution.

    This is important if you want coupler forcings that can drive a later TG
    run: Typically you will want these forcings in the same place where you
    wanted virtual columns (for the same reason: so that forcings are available
    in every elevation class, including elevation class 0).

In order to accomplish these changes, I have separated the logic for where to
compute SMB from the logic for where to do downscaling.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, for CLM45/CLM5 with CISM (IG compsets)

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM5 with CISM (IG compsets)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Not investigated closely, but expected to be larger than roundoff/same
      climate

      Differences are due to:

      (1) New downscaling equations for forc_th and forc_rho. I have confirmed
      that these differences are relatively small in one test run (one-day
      average differences < 0.31 deg for forc_th and < 1e-10 for forc_rho).

      (2) Downscaling now done over all column types within the icemask
      (including lakes)

      (3) Small change in constants used in calculation of forc_rho downscaling,
      to be consistent with shr_const_mod

      (4) Now compute SMB for all vegetated columns in the 'virtual' glacier
      region, rather than just columns in the icemask. This affects fields sent
      from CLM to the coupler in elevation class 0.
    

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Bring Rosie's respiration and FUN changes to the trunk

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changes to respiration from Rosie Fisher. Leaf respiration option (CLM50 default is Atkin 2015) 
as well as option for light inhibition. Also reworking of FUN so it calculates both fixers 
and non fixers and then figures out the impact of both based on a fixed percentage of plants
that fix by PFT. Add burned-off carbon to FUN (Carbon that can not be used for N uptake). 
Add new term to directly account for Ben Houlton's temperature response function.

New defaults for CLM5.0. Add some new history fields including
LEAFCN and LEAFCN_STORAGE CN ratios.

Default for snow depth is now lowered to 10m from 20m. If you startup from an initial condition
file with 20m of snow, a big flow of ice-runoff will flow out of the system (takes a few days
to clear it all out). In general you should NOT allow this for fully coupled simulations with
an active ocean model. For other simulations, you should be aware of this sudden ice runoff that
will happen.

Remove some unused unworking or unrefined options for flexible-CN.

Check for small C or N values in CNPrecisionControl after
each StateUpdate section rather than just after summary.
This is turned on for CLM50 with use_nguardrail (will turn this
on for CLM45 as well, and remove later).

Improve some of the documentation of namelist items. Also work on some of the dependencies:
use_flexiblcCN requires CN, carbon_resp_opt=1 only if CN on and FUN off.
use_luna on only if CN and nitrif_denitrif on.
lnc_opt depends on if CN on or off.
FUN on depends on both CN and nitrig_dentrif

FUN is very expensive in this version and causes model to be significantly slower.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 

    2302 Some missing nh4 arrays set to zero.
    2298 Init method NOT called for NutrientCompetetionFlexibleCN
    2296 Missing meta-data for new data added to params file
    2273 Log output without a "if masterproc " around it...
    2268 Irrigation unit tests broken because of irrigation limiter
    2253 Nitrogen Deposition accidentally turned off when FUN on
    2249 Low LAI over Amazon

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):

    2295 ch4 conservation error in ne30 1850 case
    2269 log(0) possibility


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users:
     This changes the default for snow capping from 20m to 10m. If you use an initial condition
     file with 20m of snow it will cut the snow depth to 10m, and send 10m of snow as ice runoff.
     This sudden influx of ice runoff could be problematic for fully coupled simulations to an
     ocean model.

Changes to CLM's user interface:
     New namelist items: leafresp_method, light_inhibit, leaf_acc, rootstem_acc, use_nguardrail
     Remove namelist   : carbon_excess_opt, carbon_storage_excess_opt, dynamic_plant_alloc_opt
     Remove vcmax_opt options 1 and 2

     new namelist group: photosyns_inparm

     carbon_resp_opt should be 0 when use_fun=.true.

     New history fields: Vcmx25Z, Jcmx25Z, LEAFCN, LEAFCN_STORAGE
                         COST_NFIX, COST_NACTIVE, COST_NRETRANS, NUPTAKE_NPP_FRACTION

     add IGM1850CRUCLM50BGCCROP and IGM1850CRUCLM50BGC compsets

Changes made to namelist defaults:

     New defaults: CLM50: leaf_acc, light_inhibit, use_bedrock, use_nguardrail all on
                          leaf_resp=2
                          h2osno_max=10m
                          use_flexibleCN (if CN on)
                          carbon_resp_opt=1 (only if use_cn ON and FUN off)
                          use_luna (only if use_cn and use_nitrif_denitrif on)
                          lnc_opt depends on CN
                          FUN on depends on CN and nitrif_denitrif
                          Change leaf_mr_vcm phys default value

Changes to the datasets:
     New params file for clm5_0 with metadata on new fields. Remove some uneeded
     parameters.

Substantial timing or memory changes: Approximately 20% slower with FUN on

One-line Summary: Major refactor of CN Products

Purpose of changes
------------------

Variables and code related to CN product pools and fluxes were scattered among
12 modules. In addition, CNWoodProducts was difficult to understand and modify,
because the same basic logic was repeated four times: once for carbon, once for
c13, once for c14 and once for nitrogen.

This tag does a major overhaul of CNWoodProducts - now renamed to CNProducts,
since it includes grain as well as wood products. This is now an object-oriented
class. The major benefits of this overhaul are:

- Only 2 modules now contain any information about the number of product pools
  and their lifetimes: CNProducts and pftconMod. Previously, 12 modules had some
  information about the fact that there were 10 & 100-year product pools. This
  makes it easier to change the number or lifetimes of product pools in the
  future. Code outside CNProducts (and pftconMod) knows that there is some flux
  to wood and crop product pools in general, but doesn't need to know anything
  about how this is partitioned into the 10 and 100-year product pools - or even
  the fact that there are 10 and 100-year product pools.

- Because this product pool information is now self-contained, with a clear
  interface, CNProductsMod could be used by ED, if this were desired.

- Changes to CNProductsMod no longer need to be replicated four times for the
  four different species. Instead, there are four instances of cn_products_type
  declared at a higher level.

This tag also introduces a "species" class (with subclasses for isotope and
non-isotope species), which can be used to remove duplication in the setting of
history and restart variables in classes for which we have one instance for each
species. This is currently used in the new CNProductsMod; eventually it can also
be used in CNVegCarbonStateType, CNVegCarbonFluxType, and the similar
SoilBiogeochem Types (at which point this should probably be moved out of the
biogeochem directory into somewhere like 'utils').

This tag also introduces a utility method for setting one restart field (not
found on the restart file) from another (which was present). This is used in a
few places in CNProductsMod, and should be used in other places as well (e.g.,
see bug 2282).


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 2297 (code looks wrong for initializing carbon isotopes from a restart file
  without isotope information)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID):
- 2256 (Problems with early versions of PIO2 in CLM) -- shows up in more
  (hobart) tests now, for unclear reasons

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_8_r172


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 / CLM50 - anything other than 1850
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

     This is complicated; ready? Let's work backwards:

     Branch tag product_pools_gridcell2_n03_clm4_5_8_r172 (which is becoming
     this trunk tag) was bit-for-bit with branch tag
     product_pool_total_fluxes_n01_clm4_5_8_r172 (from branch
     product_pool_total_fluxes), except for roundoff-level changes in c13 / c14
     product pools / fluxes for transient cases with ciso. (Those changes
     remained roundoff-level throughout the simulation, so their roundoff-level
     nature was obvious from the cprnc output.)

     Determining that the changes in product_pool_total_fluxes_n01_clm4_5_8_r172
     were no greater than roundoff-level was tricky, because these differences
     propagated over time. To do this, I created another branch:
     product_total_roundoff, with branch tag
     product_total_roundoff_n01_product_pool_total_fluxes_n01_clm4_5_8_r172. This
     was essentially the same as product_pool_total_fluxes_n01_clm4_5_8_r172,
     except that hrv_deadstemc_to_prod10c and hrv_deadstemc_to_prod100c (and
     same for nitrogen) were computed twice: once the old way and once the new
     way. The updates of deadstemc/n in CStateUpdate2h and NStateUpdate2h (which
     were the uses that caused differenes to propagate to greater than
     roundoff-level) were also done twice: once using the "old" hrv_deadstem
     values, and once with the "new" values. The "old" version was used in the
     rest of the code, but the two versions were compared for every point in
     every time step to ensure that they were never more than roundoff-level
     different. I ran the full test suite on
     product_total_roundoff_n01_product_pool_total_fluxes_n01_clm4_5_8_r172 and
     ensured that it differed by no more than roundoff-level from trunk tag
     clm4_5_8_r172.

     To summarize: I ensured that the only differences greater than
     roundoff-level in the test suite were attributable to differences in the
     order of operations when computing the hrv_deadstem*_to_prod* variables,
     and I also ensured that the new and old calculations of the
     hrv_deadstem*_to_prod* variables never differed by more than roundoff.

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Exclude land use and product pools / fluxes from CN summary diagnostics

Purpose of changes
------------------

Changed TOTCOLC, TOTECOSYSC, TOTCOLN and TOTECOSYSN (and same for C isotopes) to
no longer include product pools. Also changed NBP and NEE to no longer include
land use or product fluxes (dwt_closs and product_closs).

Removed LAND_UPTAKE diagnostic, because NEE now gives this quantity. Added
NET_CARBON_EXCHANGE, which gives the sum of NEE and the land use flux - i.e.,
what NEE used to be.

Also, changed TOTPRODN to be consistent with TOTPRODC: no longer includes crop
product pool.

The main motivation for this change is the upcoming move of product pools to the
grid cell level. However, this also addresses inconsistencies between CLM's
definition of NEE, etc., and what would be more typically considered in the
literature.

These changes to the meaning of these diagnostics were all proposed and/or
approved by Peter Lawrence.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Changes meaning of a number of diagnostics, as noted above

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

co2 flux sent to the atmosphere).


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: many CLM45 / CLM50 - see below for details
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff for prognostic fields, larger than roundoff for some diagnostic fields

      Significant changes in the diagnostic fields noted under "purpose of
      changes", above, for transient, CNDV and crop runs, and for year-2000 runs
      that used initial conditions from a transient run (so presumably had
      non-zero product pools). Changes in these diagnostic fields (if any) are
      roundoff-level for non-crop, non-CNDV, non-crop 1850 runs.

      Roundoff-level changes in CO2 flux sent to atmosphere and new FCO2
      diagnostic field for some runs.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Backout COMP_RUN_BARRIERS setting, and remove all ED tests from testlist (as they all fail)

Purpose of changes
------------------

Backout the setting of COMP_RUN_BARRIERS. It has a nasty side effect of disabling the
automatic setting of CONTINUE_RUN=TRUE when RESUBMIT>1. See bug 2280. Now production
simulations with I compsets will fail because datm is allowed to get ahead of CLM.

Also remove all of the ED tests from the testlists as they currently all fail.

One-line Summary: Add a wrapper for CN Vegetation

Purpose of changes
------------------

This tag introduces a wrapper (or "facade" in software design terms) for the CN
vegetation types and modules.

My main motivations were:

(1) Insulating the rest of the code from changes in the CNVeg
implementation. For example, I'm about to introduce a class to hold variables
related to the product pools. With the old implementation, I would have to touch
a number of modules outside of the biogeochem directory in order to do this; now
I won't.

(2) Simplifying interfaces to subroutines – reducing the number of arguments.

(3) Starting to put in place a structure that could be leveraged to support CN
and ED (and SP) side-by-side, polymorphically, so that we don't need 'if use_cn'
/ 'if use_ed' conditionals scattered throughout the code or direct "use"
statements of types in CN / ED / etc.

The changes here are a big first step towards these goals, although this isn't
yet complete. There are some notes in comments in CNVegetationFacade.F90 listing
some things that should still be done.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 2276: Need ne30_g16 surface dataset with crop for CLM45/CLM50
- 2291: fire emissions NaN with gnu compiler

Code reviews and testing
------------------------

Code reviewed by: a bit of review by Erik Kluzek and Ben Andre

CLM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - not run

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - ok

    ok means: all tests pass except expected irrigation failure

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

    yellowstone_intel - ok
    yellowstone_pgi - ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - ok

    There was one unexpected baseline failure:
    SMS_Lm25.f19_g16.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_gnu.clm-cropMonthOutput

    Upon investigation, it appeared that this was a problem in the previous tag
    (and possibly earlier): fire emissions differed between the trunk and this
    branch, and were often NaN in the trunk version (but no longer NaN on this
    branch). This seems most likely to be a compiler-related problem, since it
    seems to just appear with gnu. See bug 2291.

One-line Summary: Add fire several fire constants to namelist, add some new clm45/50 surface datasets

Purpose of changes
------------------

   Add a bunch of constants to the namelist for the CN Li fire parameterization.
   They are added in the new lifire_inparm namelist.

   Work on user interface a bit. 
     * New lifire_inparm namelist (see above)
     * Add CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINNUP env_run variable
     * Turn COMP_RUN_BARRIERS for f09 and f19 resolutions
     * New compsets: ICLM50BGCDVCROP, IHISTCLM50BGC
     * Model dies if CLM namelist isn't found
     * Models dies if use_bedrock=.true. and zbedrock NOT on surface dataset
     * Remove use_nofire move to fire_method as "nofire" option

   Add some new clm45/50 surface datasets for crop at 1850 for f45, ne30, and ne120
   Add back in the USUMB PTCLMmkdata dataset directory for testing.

   Work on testing a bit. Remove CLM50 testmods directories just there because of
   missing CLM50 compsets. Add set of complete clm40 testmod directories. Add nofire
   test, update USUMB test.  Remove use_dynroot from all but Kitchen sink tests.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): [If none, remove this line]
   2285 Problem creating ne120 surface dataset
   2280 (partial) need to set barriers for concurrent PE layouts with I compsets
   2279 Need new USUMB PTCLMmkdata directory
   2276 New ne30, ne120, f45 surface datasets for CLM45/50 1850 CROP

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

    Introduce new env_run variable: CLM_ACCELERATED_SPINUP (It can be "on" or "off")
    When "on" it sets the simulation up in such a way for it to run in an accelerated
    fashion

   (currently all it does is turn "-bgc_spinup on" if 

   NOTE: Turns on COMP_RUN_BARRIERS by default for f09 and f19 resolutions as they
         are usually run concurrent (f09 is by default).

   Add new CLM namelist: lifire_inparm

   Add new compsets: ICLM50BGCDVCROP, IHISTCLM50BGC

   NOTE: Model will now die if you set use_bedrock=.true., and your surface dataset
         doesn't have zbedrock on it.

   WARNING: Now if a CLM namelist is NOT found -- the model will abort with an error.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): Many new namelist items

   New CN fire namelist items: rh_low, rh_hgh, bt_min, bt_max, cli_scale,
       boreal_peatfire_c, pot_hmn_ign_counts_alpha, non_boreal_peatfire_c,
       cropfire_a1, and occur_hi_gdp_tree
   They are set by default according to either fire_method=li2014qianfrc or li2016crufrc

   use_nofire removed and "nofire" added as an option to fire_method

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): A few new surface datasets
   New 1850 clm45/50 surface datasets for: f45, ne30, ne120
   Alos new PTCLMmkdata USUMB directory

Substantial timing or memory changes: None known

One-line Summary: Fix zero methane production

Purpose of changes
------------------

Methane production has been zero ever since the hydrology reordering in
clm4_5_13 (in June, 2013). The order of subroutine calls appears to be a
problem:
1. CNDriverNoLeaching is called in clm_driver, which calls SetValues, which
   zeros out the carbon fluxes (e.g., somhr and lithr)
2. ch4 is called which uses the zero-ed out fluxes
3. Summary is called which sums up the soil layer som and litter heterotrophic
   respiration terms which should be used by ch4, but are not.

This tag puts the call to ch4 back where it was in clm4_5_12 and earlier.

Keith Oleson found and fixed this bug; Bill Sacks brought it to the trunk.

One-line Summary: Fix carbon isotopes in transient runs

Purpose of changes
------------------

In CNWoodProducts, code that was supposed to operate on c13 / c14 variables was
actually operating on the standard c12 variable. This led to incorrect results
and carbon balance errors if running with carbon isotopes in transient runs.

One-line Summary: Remove fglcmask, recreate all surface datasets

Purpose of changes
------------------

Remove fglcmask input file. This specified the area where we need virtual
glacier elevation classes for coupling to CISM. There were two main problems
with this:

- There was a separate file for each CLM resolution at which we can couple to
  CISM - currently this is just f09, f19, T31. There was no easy way to generate
  these files for all CLM resolutions - which is something that is needed in
  order to turn GLC on by default in all CESM runs.

- This did not provide the flexibility needed to treat three regions
  differently: Greenland (virtual columns), Antarctica (multiple elevation
  classes, but no virtual columns), and mountain glaciers (single elevation
  class).

This tag removes the fglcmask file, replacing it with an integer-valued
GLACIER_REGION field on the surface dataset, together with a
glacier_region_behavior namelist option.

I have generated all new surface datasets. In addition to adding the
GLACIER_REGION field, these:
- add zbedrock (most out-of-the-box surface datasets did not yet have this
  field)
- remove unused TOPO field

There are also new initial conditions files, simply for the sake of updating the
surface_dataset metadata.

Also changed mksurfdata_map's Makefile.data and perl script (including adding a
-no_surfdata flag) so that the necessary out-of-the-box surface datasets are all
created correctly (with correct names). Also did some other cleanup of
mksurfdata.pl.

Also removed kludgey Greenland and Antarctica areas from history file, which
weren't being used.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

   - New surface datasets have zbedrock, in contrast to many old datasets. This
     means that runs with use_bedrock = .true. will actually use bedrock now,
     changing answers

   - For any run with glc_mec (compsets with CISM): will need to run initial
     conditions through init_interp

   - For any initial conditions file of your own that was generated from an
     earlier CLM tag (i.e., not an out-of-the-box initial conditions file): will
     need to set check_finidat_fsurdat_consistency to .false., because surface
     datasets have changed

   - 1/8 deg surface dataset hasn't been updated, so won't work with this tag

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

   - New namelist variable: glacier_region_behavior

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):

   - all new surface datasets; these are the same as before, but have:
     - GLACIER_REGION added
     - TOPO removed
     - zbedrock added (wasn't yet on most default surface datasets)

   - new initial conditions files: just updated surface_dataset metadata to
     point to new surface datasets

Substantial timing or memory changes: NONE

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_7_r164


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
      - configurations with glc_mec (compsets with CISM)
      - configurations with use_bedrock = .true. for which zbedrock wasn't
        previously on the surface dataset
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      larger than roundoff; not investigated closely


      The answer changes in glc_mec runs are due to small changes in the set of
      grid cells in the single_at_atm_topo zone. I confirmed that, if I use a
      kludged-in GLACIER_REGION field that exactly matches the old fglcmask, then
      answers are bit-for-bit.

      The answer changes in use_bedrock configurations are presumably due to
      zbedrock being on the surface datasets now.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: Update CIME and MOSART

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update CLM to a robust version of CIME and PIO2 (used in the cesm1_5_beta04 tag). 
Also fix an issue in MOSART that changes answers (qgwl_volume must be multiplied 
by area). 

Note, that this version of CIME removes the archive.locked directory.

Change the rearranger that PIO uses from being hardcoded to using the one
picked  with the env_run.xml variable LND_PIO_REARRANGER (both clm40 and clm45).
By default, as before the rearranger for clm40 is the new SUBSET option, and 
for clm45/clm50 it's the old BOX method, eventually we expect both to use
the SUBSET method by default.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 
   2265 Workaround for pio_syncfile issue
   2257 Unit tests fail
   2256 Issues with early versions of PIO2

Bugs found recently:
   2264 Fire is missing accounting of C/N for transfer of live to dead

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
   This version of CIME now creates cimeteststatus instead of cs.status when create_test used
      (use the summary option to cimeteststatus "-s"!)
   Remove the archive.locked functionality and the creation of the associated hardlinks
   Removed the option DOUT_S_SAVE_DATES_RESTART_FILE_SET 

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): pio rearranger
   set the rearranger for PIO to use by the env_run variable LND_PIO_REARRANGER

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): None

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): None

Substantial timing or memory changes: PIO2 should have better performance
  and it allows two options for the rearranger to use (BOX and SUBSET).

One-line Summary: Improve crop performance by allocating less memory

Purpose of changes
------------------

Performance of crop runs was being significantly impacted by the fact that we
allocate memory for any crop column that might ever need to come into existence
with dynamic landunits. Most CLM code should not run over 0-weight points, so
this likely reflects problems in memory/cache efficiency.

This tag changes that behavior, so that for non-transient runs, we only allocate
memory for the crops that actually exist in that run (i.e., have non-zero
area). For transient crop runs, the behavior is currently the same as before.

Note that this means you need to run init_interp when transitioning from a
non-transient crop run to a transient crop run, or vice versa.

For an f09 run without i/o (20-day run with compset
1850_DATM%QIA_CLM50%BGC-CROP_SICE_SOCN_RTM_SGLC_SWAV), this resulted in:

- number of columns reduced from 674,634 to 277,728

- number of patches reduced from 968,284 to 571,378

- throughput increased from 3.821 seconds/mday to 2.404 seconds/mday

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

- need to run old crop initial conditions through init_interp (already done for
  out-of-the-box finidat files)

- from now on, need to run init_interp when transitioning from a non-transient
  crop run to a transient crop run, or vice versa

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): new finidat
files for crop: same as old, but run through init_interp

Substantial timing or memory changes: substantial improvement in both timing and
memory for crop cases


Code reviews and testing
------------------------

Code reviewed by: self

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - not run

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - irrigation test fails, as in r162

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

     yellowstone - not run

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45):

    NOTE: On yellowstone, I tested with a cime version that had a one-off from
    cime4.3.1: changes to cprnc. This was done so that cprnc would indicate
    which tests had differences in dimension sizes in the h1 history files.


    yellowstone_intel - ok
    yellowstone_pgi - ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - ok
    hobart_nag - ok

    'ok' means tests pass, baseline comparisons fail for some diagnostic fields
    for crop cases, as described below

    Also, this test failed the baseline comparison due to a problem in the
    baseline:
    ERS_D_Ld5.f10_f10.IMCRUCLM50BGC.yellowstone_intel.clm-default

    Some r162 baselines were missing on hobart; I reran these tests and verified
    that baseline comparisons passed.

One-line Summary: Collapse mountain glaciers to a single elevation class

Purpose of changes
------------------

Mountain glaciers (i.e., glaciers outside of Greenland and Antarctica) have been
problematic when running with glc_mec, because of the adjustments made to the
atmospheric forcings (downscaling to columns). Mountain glaciers generally sit
above the atmospheric forcing height, so this downscaling leads to discrepancies
between the atmospheric forcings and what CLM sees, on the gridcell mean. This
same problem can exist over ice sheets, but it can be more pronounced in
mountain regions because of the steep topography. Furthermore, because no
downscaling is done over the vegetated portion of the grid cell: Even if CLM's
mean grid cell elevation agreed exactly with the atmosphere's topographic
height, there would still be a discrepancy after downscaling, because the
glaciers would see a cooler climate, whereas the rest of the grid cell would see
exactly the climate sent by the atmosphere.

Mountain glaciers are not currently a focus of the Land Ice Working Group
(LIWG), and surface mass balance is known to have significant problems in
mountain glacier regions. Therefore, because of the above atm-lnd discrepancy,
the LIWG (especially Bill Lipscomb and Jeremy Fyke) decided it would be best to
have only a single glacier elevation class in mountain glacier regions (outside
of Greenland and Antarctica), whose elevation exactly matches the atmosphere's
topographic height. Note that this match of the atmopshere's topographic height
is the same as what is done (implicitly) in all other landunits - resulting in
no adjustment to the atmospheric forcings.

This tag implements the collapse of mountain glaciers to a single elevation
class, whose topographic height matches the atmosphere's topographic height. It
allows for the possibility that the atmosphere's topographic height could change
in time - in which case the glacier's topographic height (and potentially its
elevation class index) will change in time to follow the atmosphere.

In addition, this tag puts in place infrastructure to make it easier to define
different glacier regions that receive different treatments (whether virtual
columns are enabled, and whether glacier should be collapsed to a single
elevation class). The "frontend" user interface for this will be added in an
upcoming tag.

Currently, the definition of the "mountain glacier" region is done so that it
includes everything except the region defined by fglcmask and the region south
of 60 deg S (assumed to be Antarctica). Soon the setting of this region will be
made more robust and more easily user-definable.

Finally, this tag adds infrastructure to aid in creating and using local
column-level filters. Eventually, this could be extended to cover all of CLM's
filters.


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to run initial conditions through init_interp):
- For runs with glc_mec (IG, FG, BG), need to run initial conditions through
  init_interp, because there are now slightly fewer glc_mec columns.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
- just changed finidat for glcMEC_spunup_1way testmod

Substantial timing or memory changes:
- small decrease in memory for glc_mec runs, due to a decrease in the number of
  columns

          delegating the logic to glcBehaviorMod allows us to reduce duplication
          between initGridCellsMod and subgridMod. Also split the monster

One-line Summary: For glc_mec, get gridcell topographic height from atm

Purpose of changes
------------------

Runs with glc_mec require knowledge of the atmosphere's topographic height. Up
until now, this was specified via the flndtopo file for the three resolutions
that glc_mec can run at: f09, f19, T31. However, this has three problems:

(1) It made it hard to extend glc_mec to run at other CLM resolutions

(2) If CAM's topographic height changes (as it did recently), CLM would need to
    have its flndtopo files updated to agree.

(3) It assumes that datm's forcing heights match CAM's.

In this tag, flndtopo has been removed, and CLM now gets the atmosphere's
topographic height from the atmosphere, via the coupler. References to flndtopo
/ ldomain%topo have been replaced with atm2lnd_inst%forc_topo_grc.

For now, datm is set up to provide a topographic height that matches the old f09
file - so offline (I compset) runs at f09 will be the same as before. But this
will soon change.

Also removed fatmtopo, which was in the code in a few places but was no longer
being used.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45/CLM5 with glc_mec (IG, FG, BG)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Potentially new climate. Magnitude of change depends on how different
      atm's topography is from the flndtopo file that had been used before.

      For now, offline (IG) runs at f09 are the same as before, but all other
      offline runs change. Runs coupled to CAM may be the same (or close to the
      same), if CAM is using its old topography files, but will change for the
      new CAM topography.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Update CIME version

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update to very latest version of CIME, which we had held off doing
for two months. The main user change is that CIME no longer names
scripts with your CASENAME.

This CIME version also updated PIO1 to PIO2 (pio2_0_27). These
early versions of PIO2 do have issues with potential hangs. See
bug 2256 below. As such we do not recommend use of this tag. Or
if you do and run into problems, do the workaround in the bug
report to move the PIO version to pio1_9_23. The behavior is that
after the simulation finishes it times out when writing history and
restart files. mpi-serial (single point) cases seem to work fine.

Also fix two minor bugs.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

    2251  Bad NH max planting date of 6/31

One-line Summary: Reduce memory use for init_interp

Purpose of changes
------------------

For high-resolution source files (e.g., f09 or higher), the new multilevel
interpolation was using unacceptable amounts of memory, since it was reading all
source points at all levels into memory at once - both for the actual data to
interpolate, and for the metadata used in the multilevel interpolators.

This tag reworks how 2-d interpolation is done so that only one level from the
source is needed in memory at a time, thus greatly reducing memory use in some
cases.

In making this change, I extracted routines to do 1-d interpolation. In doing
so, I made some minor changes to their behavior for consistency. The main change
was to remove special handling of inactive points: Inactive points used to have
their values set to spval, and I have now removed that logic, keeping inactive
points at their values before interpolation. This results in some NaNs appearing
in finidat_interp_dest (if values were NaN before interpolation); before spval
was put in all inactive points.

Also, some unrelated changes:

- Remove a duplicate and unused entry in config_component.xml (found by Jim
  Edwards)

- Remove redundant settings in CNZero (found by Dave Lawrence)

- Fix cray compilation problems (found by Jim Edwards)

One-line Summary: Fix QSNWCPICE and glacial inception

Purpose of changes
------------------

Previously, qflx_snwcp_ice_col (output to history file as QSNWCPICE) had served
two purposes: (1) the snow capping flux, which is used to specify surface mass
balance to GLC; and (2) the ice runoff flux, sent to ROF. However, these two
uses are not identical, which resulted in a number of problems.

This tag separates these uses, so that qflx_snwcp_ice_col truly gives the snow
capping flux, and the ice runoff flux is derived separately (via two new
variables: qflx_ice_runoff_snwcp_col and qflx_ice_runoff_xs_col).

This changes serves the following purposes:

(1) QSNWCPICE becomes a useful history field, actually giving the amount of snow capping

(2) Fixes snow balance check: bug 2238

(3) Fixes a problem where xs1 could initiate glacial inception, by contributing to qflx_glcice_frz

(4) simplifies some logic in BalanceCheckMod

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_6_r155


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: diagnostic changes for all CLM45/CLM50;
  significant changes for IG compsets with CLM45/CLM50
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Changes for IG compsets are potentially climate changing

   Changes in non-IG compsets are in the following three fields:
   - QSNWCPICE
   - ERRH2OSNO
   - SNOW_SINKS (roundoff-level)

   Bigger changes in IG compsets are due to no longer including the xs1 term in
   qice (SMB) sent to GLC. Of the tests in the test suite, this was just
   observed for SMS_Lm37.T31_g37_gl5.IG1850CLM45.yellowstone_intel.clm-glcMEC_long.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

Tag name:  clm4_5_6_r155
Originator(s):  erik (Erik Kluzek)
Date: etl xim 23  1:11:04 carra MST 2015
One-line Summary: Bring FUN (Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen) code option to trunk from Mingjie, 
                  as well as latitude varying spinup from Charlie, and a fix for crop with dynamic 
                  roots from Beth

Purpose of changes
------------------

FUN Model (Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen): Mingjie Shi, Josh Fisher, 
                                             and implmentation changes from Rosie Fisher

  FUN is the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen, and is designed to extract N from numerous 
  sources (fixation, active uptake, retranslocation) in proportion to the inverse of the 
  cost of uptake in term of C spent per unit N acquired. 

  The FUN model developed by Fisher et al. 2010 and end Brzostek et al. 2014. Coded by Mingjie Shi 2015.
  Coding logic and structure altered by Rosie Fisher. October 2015. 
  Critically, this removes the 'FUN-resistors' idea of Brzostek et al. 2014
  and replaces it with uptake that is proportional to the N/C exchange rate. 
  and adjusts the logic so that FUN does not depends upon the CLM4.0 'FPG' downregulation idea
  and instead it takes C spent on N uptake away from growth.
  The critical output so fthis code are sminn_to_plant_fun and npp_Nuptake, which are the N 
  available to the plant for growth, and the C spent on obtaining it.

  When FUN is on and flex-CN is on, do NOT do the burn off of excess Carbon.

  Add in Kyla's rainfall trigger for stress decidious when FUN is on.

  Call FUN in the middle of SoilBiogeochemCompetition. Split CNPhenology into
  two sections for FUN. Get N available from N in NutrientCompetetion. Add
  annual average ET needed for CNFreeLivingFixation which is used in place
  of CNNFixation when FUN on.
 
Dynamic Roots bug fix: Beth Drewniak

  Initialize huigrain to zero (rather than nan). And add a check for huigrain non zero
  to prevent a divide by zero.

BGC Spinup Changes: Charlie Koven

  Add a latitude dependent factor for accellerated decomposition spinup that is 
  about 1 at the equator goes to 26 at 60 degree's latitude (south and north) 
  and then about 50 at the poles.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):  2237
    2237 (dynamic root code divides by 0)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID): 2249
   2249 Simulations have low LAI in the amazon with FUN and Luna on

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to run initial conditions through init_interp):
   LAI is low in Amazon (see bug 2249)
   FUN requires use_nitrif_denitrif to be on.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): new CLM namelist variables
   Add br_root (maintenence respiration for roots)
   And leaf_mr_vcm (Scalar of leaf respiration to vcmax)
   And use_fun logical to turn the FUN model on

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
   For CLM50 set leaf_mr_vcm to 0.032 (from Atkin 2015)
   For CLM50 with FUN on br_root=2.525e-06

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
   New params files with FUN parameters on them

Substantial timing or memory changes: Slower with FUN
    Will notices that simulations with FUN are slower
    (there are optimization issues that I saw that could be worked on)

Code reviews and testing
------------------------

Code reviewed by: self, rfisher, koven, drewniak

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - PASS

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - PASS

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45):

    yellowstone_intel - OK
    yellowstone_pgi - OK
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - OK
    hobart_nag - OK

OK, means tests PASS or only expected fails do not.
SSP comparision tests FAIL for CLM50, since spinup changes


CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons:  clm4_5_6_r154

Tag name:  clm4_5_6_r154

One-line Summary: one year grain product pool

Purpose of changes
------------------

  Introduce logic to have the harvested grain products decay over the
  course of one year. This is distinct from previous versions, in
  which the grain products decayed immediately. Including the one-year
  decay time changes soil carbon and nitrogen pools, and is on by
  default in the CLM5 crop model. (Danica Lombardozzi, Dave Lawrence)

  Add temporary test for all the clm50 functionality being used in the
  preliminary cesm2 coupled run:

    ERS_D_Ld3.f09_g16_gl5.IGCRUCLM50BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-clm50KitchenSink

  Note: Because of the brittle situation with the surface
  datasets/initial conditions files being inconsistent, we had to use
  the f09 grid for this test. The run length was kept short to keep
  the wall clock time ~30 min. This is too short exercise some new
  clm50 functionality, e.g. one year grain product pool.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to run initial conditions through init_interp): none

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

  New namelist variables: use_fertilizer, use_grainproduct

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: unknown, none expected


Code reviews and testing
------------------------

Code reviewed by: Lombardozzi, Sacks

CLM testing: regular

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - unit tests pass

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - pass

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    yellowstone - n/a, not run

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

     yellowstone - n/a, not run

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45):

    yellowstone_intel - 4.0 pass; 4.5 ok
    yellowstone_pgi - 4.0 pass; 4.5 ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only) - 4.5 ok
    hobart_nag - 4.5 ok

    'ok' means: all tests passed functionality and baseline
    comparisons. only nlcomp failures. new test did not have a
    baseline.

  Note: Grain product pool is active by default for clm50 with crops,
  and will change answers. None of the tests are affected because they
  do not run long enough to trigger the new code.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_6_r153


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: yes

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: clm50-crop
    - what platforms/compilers: all/all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      expected to be larger than roundoff, same climate.

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: none

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: none

Tag name:  clm4_5_6_r153
Originator(s):  Sean Swenson, Bill Sacks

One-line Summary: Fix snow cover fraction bug

Purpose of changes
------------------

The fix for infinite snow growth made in clm4_5_3_r144 turned out to have a bug
of its own: It made snow cover fraction rarely reach ~ 1, instead maxing out
around 0.8 or 0.9.

This tag fixes the snow cover fraction bug while still (it appears) preventing
infinite snow growth.

This results in a potentially large change in model behavior, so the version
number is bumped from clm4_5_5 to clm4_5_6. However, this is mainly due to
backing out some of the (buggy) changes that were put in place in
clm4_5_3_r144. That is, if the changes in this new tag were made on top of
clm4_5_3_r143, the differences would likely be relatively small.

Changes made by Sean Swenson, brought to trunk by Bill Sacks.

One-line Summary: Fix glc_mec energy conservation bug

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fix an energy conservation bug that appears when running glc_mec (i.e., in runs
with CISM). Energy loss due to ice melt was essentially being double-counted:
First, all snow capping was being sent as ice runoff, and thus melted by the
ocean; in addition, glacier ice melt removed energy from CLM. This removal of
energy due to both accumulation (snow capping) and melt amounts to
double-counting.

This is fixed by: For each unit of ice melt, remove one unit of ice runoff
(possibly resulting in negative ice runoff), adding one unit of liquid
runoff. You can think of this as: each unit of ice melt indicates one unit of
snow capping that should not have made it to the ocean, but instead melted en
route.

Note that we currently adjust qflx_snwcp_ice in order to achieve this ice runoff
adjustment. This affects the QSNWCPICE history field. (In an upcoming tag, I
plan to return qflx_snwcp_ice to its original values (i.e., truly indicating
snow capping), by introducing a new field that explicitly gives ice runoff.)

This tag also fixes a minor bug in the calculation of negative runoff for
glc_mec columns with glc_dyn_runoff_routing=T. In addition, it reorders some
code in HydrologyDrainageMod in order to remove some complexity.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All IG compsets (compsets with CISM / glc_mec)
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Likely new climate

      For each unit of glacier melt, there is an extra unit of liquid runoff,
      and one unit less of ice runoff.

      This results in changes in the following CLM history fields: ERRH2O,
      ERRH2OSNO, QRGWL, QRUNOFF, QRUNOFF_TO_COUPLER, QSNWCPICE,
      QSNWCPICE_TO_COUPLER, TWS, VOLR, VOLRMCH

      And the following changes in l2x cpl hist fields: l2x_Flrl_rofdto,
      l2x_Flrl_rofgwl, l2x_Flrl_rofi

      There are also changes in the consequent x2r, r2x and x2l cpl hist fields.

      I did one test run to confirm that the differences in (l2x_Flrl_rofdto +
      l2x_Flrl_rofgwl) exactly balanced the differences in l2x_Flrl_rofi.

One-line Summary: Some needed answer changing fixes for: fire, disallow negative photosynthis, 
                  and reduce LAI of DBT in evergreen state

Purpose of changes
------------------

Add in changes to fire fluxes for deadstem (both clm4_5 and clm5_0). Don't allow
photosynthis to be less than zero. Reduce the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of Deciduous 
Broadleaf Tree (DBT) when in an evergreen state (warm enough that all of the leaves never
all fall off) by taking into account leaf longevity and only allowing the amount of 
leaf or fine root Carbon storage transfered to be more than the amount of remaining leaf 
or fine root Carbon (would be zero unless in an evergreen state). Previously, DBT in 
evergreen state would have unrealistically high LAI, that would then cause them to take up 
too much water and then kill the trees. So they had an unrealistic cycle for trees that are 
supposed to be in an evergreen state.

One-line Summary: Change cold start initialization of snow pack

Purpose of changes
------------------

Change cold start initialization of snow pack to lead to fewer instances where
cold start conditions negatively impact the simulation for long periods. Main
change is to make initial snow pack over glacier and high-latitude vegetation
much smaller.

Also make istice consistent with istice_mec.

New method developed in conjunction with Jan Lenaerts, Leo van Kampenhout, and

One-line Summary: For CLM5, increase max snow depth to 20 m

Purpose of changes
------------------

Change CLM5 snow defaults:

- h2osno_max = 20m rather than 1m

- nlevsno = 12 rather than 5

- glc_snow_persistence_max_days = 0 rather than 7300 (this is just used for
  modeling glacial inception when coupled to CISM)


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to run initial conditions through init_interp):

   For CLM5 cases, need to run initial conditions through init_interp, because
   of the change in nlevsno. See caveats under clm4_5_3_r146 before doing so.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):

- h2osno_max = 20m rather than 1m

- nlevsno = 12 rather than 5

- glc_snow_persistence_max_days = 0 rather than 7300 (this is just used for
  modeling glacial inception when coupled to CISM)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes:

   This change will lead to some memory increase, and some increase in timing,
   due to having more snow layers. I have not investigated this closely. The
   tputcomp tests all passed, but these are not very meaningful - in part
   because there likely weren't any grid cells with substantially more than 5
   layers in these test runs.

One-line Summary: swenson bedrock and coupler runoff bugfixes

Purpose of changes
------------------

  Science bugfixs from Sean Swenson for bedrock and coupler runoff fields.

    The bugfix for bedrock corrects an issue where running with debug
    flags and bedrock on would generate floating point errors or
    unreproducible behavior when run with a surface data set that
    contained bedrock data.

    coupler runoff fields bugfix: splitting of runoff for mosart did
    not contain all surface and subsurface fields. surface runoff is
    the sum of qflx_over, qflx_h2osfc_surf, and qflx_irrig. subsurface
    runoff is the sum of qflx_drain and qflx_perched_drain

  Add cropColdStart test mods directory missing from r145.

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: clm45/clm50
    - what platforms/compilers: all/all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): larger than roundoff

   All clm45 and clm50 compsets will have answer changes in the clm
   and coupler history files because of changes to the runoff passed
   from clm to the coupler. Only the following fields have changed:

   clm: TWS, VOLRMCH, VOLR

One-line Summary: Implement vertical interpolation in init_interp

Purpose of changes
------------------

The major requirements this addresses are:

(1) Handle changes in the vertical discretization of the soil column,
    including changing the number of layers and/or changing the depth of layers.

(2) Handle changes in which soil layers are considered bedrock vs. "standard"
    soil: Information from bedrock layers should not be transmitted to soil
    layers, and vice versa.

(3) Handle changing number of snow layers

There was previously-existing code to handle (1). However, while it was mostly
right, it was hard-coded to just handle the interpolation from "standard"
vertical levels to "more_vertlevels". And there were a number of special cases
that it mis-handled (such as urban points, which have a different vertical
discretization; also, spvals were not handled correctly). It was also going to
be hard to fit requirements #2 and #3 into the old code. So I removed the old
code and replaced it with a new, object-oriented design.

Because the number of files involved in init_interp has now grown significantly,
I have moved this code to a new directory (src/init_interp).

As part of the handling of vertical interpolation, I needed to fix a few
inconsistencies in the use of spval in some multi-level fields (see below for
details).

Finally, to aid with testing of this new code, and because it is useful in
general, Sean Swenson added nbedrock to the first history file of a run.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include bugzilla ID): [If none, remove this line]
- 2239: need new initial conditions files with extra metadata on them


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to run initial conditions through init_interp):

- If you want to use init_interp on an initial conditions file generated prior
  to this tag, you will need to first get some new metadata onto your initial
  conditions file: COL_Z, LEVGRND_CLASS, COL_Z_p and LEVGRND_CLASS_p. You have
  two options for how to do this:

  (1) Run the model for a short time using this tag, with a configuration that
      matches the source file, using the source file as finidat (with
      use_init_interp = .false.), in order to produce a new restart file with
      the necessary metadata.  Then use that new file as the finidat file for
      init_interp.
  
  (2) If that is not possible, then an alternative is to run the model for a
      short time using this tag, with cold start initial conditions (finidat = " ").
      Then use a tool like ncks to copy the misssing fields onto the original source
      finidat file. Then use that patched file as the finidat file for
      init_interp. CAUTION: A bug in the netcdf library means that adding fields
      using ncks can result in data corruption of existing fields. I have
      observed this in the plant_nalloc field, which fortunately does not seem
      to be needed at all on the restart file. However, if you use this method,
      you should compare the old and new files to ensure that nothing other than
      plant_nalloc has been changed.


Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): none

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
   Some new initial conditions files: same as old, but with metadata needed for
   running them through init_interp

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 / CLM50 runs that use init_interp to
  interpolate to a different resolution
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
        larger than roundoff; not investigated closely

    Changes arise from the fact that multi-level points are now interpolated
    rather than copied from the input to the output. This changes results for
    urban points, where the vertical level structure of walls and rooves varies
    from gridcell to gridcell.

    There are also FILLDIFFs in SOILLIQ and SOILICE in vector (dov2xy = .false.)
    history files, due to a bug fix in the treatment of spval for these
    variables.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

  - Some history output variables are now inactive by default:
    CONC_CH4_SAT, CONC_CH4_UNSAT, FPI, N tendency due to vertical
    transport, vertically resolved N.

  - Some history output is now active by default: O2 decomp depth
    unsat, SMINN.

  - Update cime configuration to allow creation of CLM 5.0 crop compsets.

  - Update clm4.0 for pio2 from Jim Edwards.

  Test list update from Ben Andre

One-line Summary: Fix bug in initialization of 12-layer snow pack

Purpose of changes:

   Expand the dzmax arrays to have 12 elements, with the last element being
   'huge'. This fixes a bug in the initialization of the snow pack when you try
   to initialize it to need all 12 layers. And, more generally, this helps avoid
   special-case code that would otherwise be needed to handle the edge case at
   the bottom layer.

One-line Summary: Fix bug that leads to infinite growth in snow depth

Purpose of changes:

   Restore 'qflx_snow_grnd_col(c) > 0.0_r8' condition in check for whether snow
   pack should be initialized. This was removed in clm4_5_1_r121, because Leo found
   that, in some rare cases, with this condition in place, the snow pack wasn't
   being initialized when it should have been. However, we have more recently found
   that, without this condition, there are some rare cases when snow depth can grow
   infinitely - and Keith Oleson traced this bug to the removal of this condition.

   We haven't managed to trace the entire logic here, but for now we feel it's
   safest to restore this condition.

One-line Summary: dynamic roots from Beth Drewniak

Purpose of changes:

  Introduce dynamic roots from Beth Drewniak.  Allows roots to grow
  dynamically, optimizing for water and nutrient uptake.  Crop roots
  start from zero each season.  Generally leads to higher root
  densities near the surface, but also deeper maximum root depth.
  Overall, water stress is reduced.  If use_bedrock = true, roots are
  confined exist in soil layers only.  Root litter is input into the
  soil according to the dynamic root distribution.

One-line Summary: new accelerated spinup and soil vertical structure

Purpose of changes: Two sets of changes are included in this tag:

  Accelerated spinup
 
    New accelerated spinup mode introduced from Dan Ricciuto.
    Acceleration factors are calculated directly from the base
    decomposition rates for each pool and CWD is added to the pools that
    are accelerated.  Wood mortality is also accelerated by a factor of 10
    through increasing rates of gap mortality and fire.
     
    There are now three accelerated spinup modes
     
    Spinup_state = 0  ; no accelerated spinup
    Spinup_state = 1 ; standard accelerated spinup
    Spinup_state = 2 ; accelerated accelerated spinup
     
    Set through env_run.xml  (-bgc_spinup on) and via namelist.
     
    In tests, new spinup method accelerates spinup by ~ a factor of 2 for
    a case starting from pre-spunup conditions but shifting to another
    forcing dataset.
 
  Vertical soil structure
 
    The vertical soil structure has been cleaned up and a new vertical
    soil structure has been added.  The namelist options more_vertlayers
    and deep_soilcolumn have been removed and replaced with the more
    general soil_layerstruct.  Four options for soil_layerstruct are
    included.
     
    10SL_3.5m - original soil structure from CLM4.5 and prior versions
    20SL_8.5m - proposed new soil structure for CLM5
    23SL_3.5m - replaces more_vertlayers
    49SL_10m  - replace deep_soilcolumn

One-line Summary: Bring in changes for fire-emissions as well tuning changes to the  fire model to be used with clm5_0

Purpose of changes:
     Move fire_clm4_5_2_r128_tags/fire06_clm4_5_3_r136 branch originated from Francis Vitt and Fang Li
     to trunk. This does two things: sends fire-emissions from land to coupler (then to ATM), and has
     an updated (retuned) version of CNFire from Fang Li. The retuned version is tuned for running with
     CAM, but there are fire parameter changes that allow it to be tuned with CRU forcing.

     CLM can test fire-emissions with the -fire_emis option to CLM_BLDNML_OPTS. Coupled configurations
     with CAM-CHEM will turn on fire-emissions when fire_emis_nl namelist added to drv_flds_in coupler
     namelist file.

Requirements for tag: fire-emissions added and tested, clm4_5 identical, clm5_0 uses newly tuned fire-model

Test level of tag: regular

One-line Summary: Substantial reduction in memory allocation for prognostic crops

Purpose of changes:

   With the introduction of "global" crops (78 pfts), memory use was increased
   substantially. The memory use itself was not a problem, but this led to a
   significant model slow-down, presumably due to a decrease in cache use
   efficiency. Much of this increase in memory use was unnecessary: CLM only
   knows about a minority of the new crop functional types (CFTs) - other CFTs
   are merged into those known CFTs. Yet space was being set aside in the patch
   and column-level arrays even for the CFTs that are never used.

   In this tag, I have reduced prognostic crop memory use by only allocating
   space in patch and column-level arrays for the crops CLM knows about.

   This leads to a speedup of prognostic crop cases by about 1.5x.

One-line Summary: Fixes for transient and preindustrial crop cases

Purpose of changes:

   (1) Important bug fix for transient crop: Collapse crop types in the
       transient run. Previously, when the transient portion started, (a) the
       collapse of the 78 pfts to the "known" crops was not happening, and (b)
       the collapse of irrigated pfts in a non-irrigation run was not
       happening. These two problems are fixed now.

   (2) Restore lost transient crop test cases

   (3) Add 1850 crop raw dataset (created using
       https://github.com/billsacks/clm_misc-make_crop_1850_dataset)

   (4) Add out-of-the-box surface datasets for 1850 crop, and out-of-the-box
       landuse timeseries datasets for transient crop

          file, I'm willing to accept that this is needed. I have made this
          tolerance about 2 orders of magnitude looser than the differences I
          observed, to try to prevent the check from being wrongly triggered in
          the future. The tolerance of 1e-6 still seems sufficient to catch any
          real problems.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_3_r132

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES - just for transient crop cases

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: transient crop cases
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      not investigated, likely to be new climate

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A


   Note that there were no transient crop tests in the test suite prior to this
   tag, so the answer changes do not affect any existing tests.

   Note the following unexpected BFAILs:

One-line Summary: Bring in cime3

Purpose of changes:

   Bring in cime3 (de-CESMization of CIME), which requires the addition of a
   cime_config directory and a bit of other rework.

   Also, port the pnetcdf problem with dov2xy=false from clm45 to clm4 code base
   (workaround for bug 1730 - and 2214 and 2222). This was needed because now
   pnetcdf is on by default in most runs.

Requirements for tag:

Test level of tag: regular

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 2214: CLM4 test fails in PIO while trying to write h1 file
- 2222: CLM4 cases die when writing 1-d history files with pnetcdf

Changes answers relative to baseline: yes

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all clm50 compsets
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):

     When active, these changes will be climate changing.  Lake
     evaporation and irrigation limitation will change the surface energy
     balance by reducing latent heat and increasing sensible heat when
     river storage is below a threshold value.  Constraining leaf onset
     with a secondary constraint will modify vegetation dynamics,
     e.g. LAI will differ in magnitude and seasonality, which will change
     the surface energy balance by altering evapotranspiration.

     Note: all of the aux_clm tests for clm50 compsets triggered were
     bit for bit with the baseline. The stress deciduous flag is on by
     default for clm50, and changes should have been observed. Sean
     Swenson verified that the flag is active in 30 day runs, so it is
     assumed that the shorter three and nine day runs were not enough
     to trigger the new code. A new 30 day test was added.

One-line Summary: bump tag revision number because clm4_5_2_r128 was climate changing.

Purpose of changes:

    Bump tag revision number only. This is the same code base as
    clm4_5_2_r128. No additional testing was done.

    Further review of the answer changes in clm4_5_2_r128 indicated
    that they were a climate changing bugfix, and the patch level
    version number should have been bumped.

    S. Swenson and D. Lawrence performed a code review of the changes
    and decided the original calculation of heat capacity for soil
    layers > nlevsoi (i.e. bedrock layers) was incorrect due to the
    heat capacity being scaled by (1-watsat).  This scaling, which
    takes into account the presence of soil voids (the porosity), is
    not appropriate for the bedrock layers, which are assumed to be
    rock rather than soil.  The new code simply applies the bedrock
    value for heat capacity without the scaling, which leads to an
    increase in heat content for bedrock layers.  The code change
    therefore results in non-b4b changes to the simulation.

Purpose of changes:

    1) To explicitly set rooting fraction to zero in baresoil patches.

    2) To place definition of bedrock heat capacity in a location
	consistent with other bedrock parameters (e.g. thermal conductivity).

One-line Summary: Fix interpolation of initial conditions for glc_mec and crop <-> non-crop

Purpose of changes:

   Fixes the following bugs in initInterp: (1) interpolation of one glc_mec case
   to another glc_mec case (due to bug 2126); (2) interpolation of a non-crop
   case to a crop case (problems with generic crop type); (3) interpolation of a
   crop case to a non-crop case (problems with generic crop type).

   Note: If you want to use initInterp with an old glc_mec initial conditions
   file (generated before this tag), you will need to either: (1) run the same
   case with this tag or later, without use_init_interp, for at least one time
   step to generate a new (fixed) initial conditions file; or (2) overwrite the
   pfts1d_topoglc variable on your original initial conditions file so that it
   has the correct size. (1) is easier if it is feasible for you to do so.

   Some related changes to initInterp:

   - Changed the "user interface" for interpolating initial conditions: There is
     no longer a finidat_interp_source namelist option; instead, you set finidat
     to point to the initial conditions file to interpolate, and set the
     use_init_interp namelist option to .true.

   - Changed the default behavior so that it does NOT fill missing points (e.g.,
     landunits that are in the new case but not on the input file) with the bare
     ground patch / vegetated landunit. Instead, it dies with an error message
     if it can't find a reasonable template column. If you want to it to use the
     nearest bare ground / vegetated point in this case, then rerun with
     init_interp_fill_missing_with_natveg set to .true.

   - Added system and unit tests of initInterp. System tests include both
     interpolation of a file onto an identical configuration, and ensuring they
     are bit-for-bit (LII test), and tests that involve interpolation from one
     resolution or configuration to another. For the latter, I have done some
     very quick checks, but have NOT carefully checked the current operation to
     ensure it is correct.

   Some (mostly) unrelated changes:

   (1) Write more metadata on column type to 1-d (vector) history files

   (2) Updated cime; this included, among other things:
   - fix RESUBMIT bug
   - no longer set FORCE_COLDSTART for glc_mec runs
   - addition of LII test

One-line Summary: Wind-dependent snow density

Purpose of changes:

   Add an option to make snow density dependent on wind speed. There are two
   components to this: (1) adding a wind-related factor to the fresh snow
   density, and (2) adding a wind-related factor for the compaction of the
   existing snow pack (applying just to the top layer). This allows for more
   realistic (higher) fresh snow densities in windy conditions.

   Other than myself, contributors to these changes are: Jan Lenaerts, Leo van
   Kampenhout and Drew Slater.

One-line Summary: Fix some problems with pgi and nag compilers

Purpose of changes:

   (1) Fix some problems with the nag compiler: fix bug 2208, but open new bug
       2213

   (2) Work around some problems that appear with pgi 15.7 (appear to be
       compiler bugs), which Sean Santos tracked down: The key problem is that
       PGI is exporting some names that should have been aliased. So for
       instance:

       use foo_mod, only: foo_bar => bar

       In this case, if you have a "use" without an "only" of foo_mod, you get
       both foo_bar and bar imported into the namespace.

       Note: I have not been able to test these changes with pgi 15.7, because
       there is a PIO build problem with pgi 15.7

   (3) No longer kill the run if we're using ozone with pgi: The pgi compiler
       bug that showed up with the ozone code has been fixed as of pgi 15.1,
       which is now our default.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

    to unallocated memory

One-line Summary: Rework snow capping

Purpose of changes:

   Main change is a complete rework of snow capping. Previously, when the snow
   pack was in a "capped" state (i.e., h2osno >= h2osno_max), new snow and rain
   were prevented from falling on the snow pack: it was as if someone put a roof
   over the snow. (However, there were workarounds in place that caused the
   aerosol concentration and snow grain size in the top snow layer to continue
   to evolve as if new snow was still falling.) This was problematic in terms of
   the long-term evolution of the snow pack, since in effect the new, less dense
   snow was being removed due to capping. So, at least in some regions, the snow
   pack became much more dense than it should be.

   The new snow capping scheme allows snow and rain to fall on the top as they
   would in the uncapped state. But if h2osno exceeds h2osno_max, then mass is
   removed from the *bottom* snow layer. This removes the need for the old
   workarounds, and is more physically realistic: This represents the process of
   converting snow to glacial ice, which in reality occurs at the bottom (most
   dense) portion of the snow pack.


   Also, a mostly-unrelated change: rearrange the multi-layer snow history
   fields, so that index 1 is always the top of the snow pack.

    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Definitely larger than roundoff. Whether this is the same or new climate
      has not been investigated carefully. However, at least in some regions
      with persistent snow cover, this change has a significant effect on the
      evolution of the snow pack, as described above.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse

One-line Summary: Bring hobart/nag bug fixes to trunk, and fix a few bugs

Purpose of changes:

Bring hobart/nag bug fixes to trunk. Fix ncl6.3.0 bug for getregional script. 
Fix use_c13 bug. Update RTM to handle regional direction files. Make sure _r8
constants in ED have a decimal point, so the NAG compiler will treat them as
double-precision rather than as integer*2.

Move testing from goldbach to hobart. For hobart_nag make all of the tests
on just one node (24 processors).

Requirements for tag: compile run with hobart/nag (fix bugs 2205 and 2199)
                      move testing from goldbach to hobart

    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only): ok
    goldbach_nag: ok - but see caveat below!

As noted above, there are three new test failures. The ERS_D ICLM45ED failure
seems to be a legitimate bug in CLM. The other two (CFAIL
CME_Ld5.f10_f10.ICN.yellowstone_intel and FAIL
NCK_Ld1.f10_f10.ICRUCLM45.yellowstone_intel.clm-default) seem to be intermittent
failures, likely due to a bug in the test system or elsewhere in cime. These
sometimes pass and sometimes fail. They always seem to pass when run as single
tests, but sometimes fail when run as part of a test suite. It's not clear if
the new cime is to blame directly, or if these are arising now simply because
tests are being run in a different order.

golbach-nag does not run out-of-the-box with this tag. However, it should run
out-of-the-box if you merge in the next commit in cime master
(4b52ec73086a4290323dddfde6087a6d6d12ab96). I did my changes with that commit
merged in, but this hadn't come to master in time for me to include it in this
CLM tag.

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,

    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Likely larger than roundoff/same climate (but not investigated closely)

      These changes are due to a complete rework of the coupling between CISM
      and CLM, manifested as major changes in the CIME and CISM externals. (The
      changes in CLM are not directly responsible for the answer changes.)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse

One-line Summary: Repartition rain vs. snow from atmosphere

Purpose of changes:

   Add an option to repartition rain vs. snow from atmosphere based on
   near-surface temperature. This repartitioning uses a ramp-based partitioning
   that is also used in datm: we ignore the rain vs. snow partitioning sent from
   the atmosphere, and generate our own rain vs. snow partitioning. A sensible
   heat flux is generated to conserve energy with this repartitioning.

   The motivation for this is two-fold:

   (1) There are biases in CAM which cause rain to be generated in cold
       conditions. This is particularly a problem for glacier surface mass
       balance in Greenland. Andrew Gettelman has suggested putting in place
       this workaround in CLM until CAM can find a robust fix.

   (2) With the downscaling to glacier elevation classes, it is useful to have
       a different rain/snow partitioning in each elevation class. 

   This repartitioning is on by default in CLM5, off by default in CLM4.5.

   If / when the CAM bias is fixed, we could potentially change this code so
   that it just does the repartitioning over the do_smb filter, similarly to the
   other downscaling in atm2lndMod. (Rather than doing this correction
   everywhere - which we do now in order to correct the rain vs. snow
   partitioning bias in CAM.)

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM5 cases
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Likely new climate, but not investigated closely

   Answer changes are due to new rain vs. snow partitioning, which is on by
   default in CLM5.

   Also changes answers for
   ERP_D_Ld5.f19_g16.ICLM45GLCMEC.yellowstone_intel.clm-glcMEC_changeFlags
   (expected, since it no longer downscales precip).

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: Rename some history fields

Purpose of changes:

   (1) Make QSNOMELT point to qflx_snomelt, as it does in CLM4.0, rather than
   qflx_snow_drain (previously qflx_snow_melt)

   (2) Turn on QSNOFRZ by default (parallels QSNOMELT)

   (3) For the 3 history fields that have FOO and FOO_NODYNLNDUSE versions:
   Rename FOO to FOO_TO_COUPLER and FOO_NODYNLNDUSE to FOO. This is at Sean
   Swenson's suggestion: He points out that the version without the dyn landuse
   adjustment (and, soon, the sensible heat adjustment from rain/snow
   conversion) is the one most people will be interested in, so should be the
   one without the suffix.

   (4) Tweak test lists:

   (a) Move prealpha & prebeta goldbach tests to hobart

   (b) Move an aux_clm45 pgi test to intel: With recent versions of cime
   (starting with cime1.1.0), threading tests with pgi take a very long time. So
   this test took 3 hours with pgi, vs 20 min with intel.

One-line Summary: Remove redundant code, rename a variable

Purpose of changes:

   (1) Remove some redundant code in SnowHydrologyMod, related to 'void'. This
   was supposed to be removed a long time ago. (Apparently the issue this was
   trying to fix was fixed in a different, more robust way.)

   (2) Remove redundant, unused copy of accumulMod in utils/ (newer copy is in
   main/)

   (3) Rename qflx_snow_melt to qflx_snow_drain, to avoid confusion with the
   existing qflx_snomelt.

   (4) Clarify documentation of snowdp_col

One-line Summary: Update cime external, remove genf90-generated files

Purpose of changes:

   Main purpose is to update the cime external to the version in cesm1_4_beta05.

   This also required updating the unit test build to use genf90 during the
   build rather than relying on already-generated files.

   Making this change led to some genf90'd files being regenerated in-source
   during the unit test build, which would lead these files to be updated every
   time we make a tag. To avoid this annoyance, I have removed the genf90'd
   files from the repository: These are not needed any more in either the unit
   test or system builds, and it simplifies things to remove them.

   Then I added an svn:ignore property to ignore files generated by genf90
   during the unit test build.

One-line Summary: Support backwards compatibility of restart variable names

Purpose of changes:

   Previously, if a restart variable was renamed, backwards compatibility was
   implemented in an ad-hoc manner. A key point is taht none of these ad-hoc
   solutions allowed backwards compatibility when running
   initInterp. (initInterp would just skip any variable if it could not find an
   exact match on the input [template] file.)

   This tag provides a standard mechanism for putting in place backwards
   compatibility when renaming a restart variable. This backwards compatibility
   carries over to initInterp, by communicating the necessary metadata through a
   new attribute on the restart file: 'varnames_on_old_files'.

   In order to use this new mechanism, give a colon-delimited list of variable
   names in the varname argument to restartvar. For example, if a restart
   variable FOO has been renamed to BAR, then specify varname='BAR:FOO'. Note
   that this list is searched in order, and the first item should be the current
   restart variable name.

   Also, applied this new mechanism to the recently-added LIQCAN
   variable. Previously, backwards compatibility of this variable was handled in
   an ad-hoc manner, which did not work when running initInterp.

   In order to get bit-for-bit results in clm4_5_1_r110 (relative to r109), we
   put in place a temporary hack in InitSnowLayers that set dz based on the old
   equations rather than the new, more general ones - thus avoiding
   roundoff-level changes. This looked like:

             if (abs(dz(c,0)-3.59_r8) < eps) then ! TODO remove
                col%dz(c, 0) = snow_depth(c)-col%dz(c,-4)-col%dz(c,-3)-col%dz(c,-2)-col%dz(c,-1)
                if (abs(dz(c,0)-3.59_r8) > eps) &
                   call endrun(msg=errmsg(__FILE__, __LINE__))
             endif 

   This tag removes that temporary hack.

   In this way, we have separated the answer-changing from non-answer-changing
   parts of the r110 refactor. Note that the above code confirms that the
   differences are no larger than roundoff (eps was 1e-9 in the above case, but
   some tests showed that it could have been much smaller - e.g., ~ 1e-15).

    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
         roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

      See above code sample, which confirms that the changes were no greater
      than roundoff-level.

One-line Summary: Add flexibility to have more snow layers

Purpose of changes:

   Generalize snow code so that it no longer assumes 5 snow layers. Instead,
   make the number of snow layers (and the maximum SWE in the snow pack) a
   runtime parameter, allowing 3 - 12 snow layers.

   Most changes were made by Leo van Kampenhout (l.vankampenhout@uu.nl).

One-line Summary: Fix bug in DivideSnowLayers

Purpose of changes:

   Fix bug in DivideSnowLayers. Leo van Kampenhout (l.vankampenhout@uu.nl)
   discovered the bug and determined how to fix it. He found this bug in the
   course of refactoring this routine to introduce loops; without this bug fix,
   answers differed with his new logic that removes duplication.

   Specifically: Logic using many IF-statements is employed to see whether or
   not a layer may be subdivided, depending on the layer thickness. Currently,
   the test for subdividing the BOTTOM layer are only reachable when the layer
   above it was also too thick.  As it turns out, this is faulty as a situation
   can arise where the bottom layers grows even though the layer above it was
   not divided, i.e. dumped mass to it.  The current understanding is that this
   happens through meltwater percolation (liquid h2o is translated to thickness
   as well).

   Note that the indentation has not been appropriately corrected, this is because this
   fix is only temporary (less cluttered logic will be implemented next).

One-line Summary: Fix CO2 forcing for MEGAN

Purpose of changes:

Bring in changes from Francis Vitt, and Louisa Emmons to correct CO2 forcing
for MEGAN and dry-deposition. Previously, the fixed value of CO2 was being used
rather than using the CO2 forcing sent in from the atmosphere model.

Also fix some issues with clm4_0 code where some urban diagnostic fields have
a different fill-value pattern on restart from startup. Fill-value is now only
set over non-land, and areas without urban, are set to zero.

One-line Summary: Move test lists to beneath active components, change build scripts from cshell 
                  to perl, move to new cime directory structure

Purpose of changes:

   * Move CESM test lists from under scripts to under active components.
      Now clm and rtm have their own CESM test lists under their "cimetest" directory.
   * Change build scripts from cshell to perl
      cshell is buggy with arbitrary problems with line lengths and number of arguments
      cshell doesn't allow long scripts to be broken up into subroutine -- perl does

One-line Summary: enable transient crops

Purpose of changes:

(1) Allow transient crops! Note that carbon and nitrogen conservation still is
    not done, but this at least allows crop areas to evolve in time.

(2) Add control flags for which pieces of the transient dynamics should be done:
    transient natural PFTs, transient crops, and/or harvest.

(3) Reworked both source code and unit tests to be able to use the true CLM time
    manager in unit tests rather than a stub version. Also added functionality
    to time_info_type to be able to take the date from the end of the current
    time step or the beginning of the time step. This flexibility was needed
    because: (a) for crops, with an annual update, I wanted the update time to
    be consistent with the glacier update time: the first time step after
    crossing the year boundary (so take time from the start of the time step);
    (b) for transient PFTs and harvest, for consistency with what was being done
    before, we need to take the time from the end of the time step.

(4) Make CNBalanceCheck more modular and object-oriented. Also, bypass the
    balance check for newly-active columns, which is needed to avoid balance
    check errors with transient crops.

One-line Summary: make new input datasets to support transient crops

Purpose of changes:

While the main purpose of this tag was to make new input datasets to support
transient crops, it also includes a number of reworks of mksurfdata_map, which
were either central or tangential to this overall goal. Specifically:

(1) Update mksurfdata_map to be able to generate datasets with transient
    crops. Currently the logic uses the non-prognostic-crop raw data for the
    transient time series: It takes the area of the generic crop from that
    timeseries to specify the transient PCT_CROP area, and sets the PCT_CFT
    areas based on the year-2000 areas.

(2) Rewrite mksurfdata_map code that normalizes pct_pft to account for special
    landunits. The code to handle urban was very confusing, and I hope this new
    code is at least astep towards being less confusing. Note that this
    introduces roundoff-level differences.

(3) Introduce new mksurfdata_map utility routines: ncd_def_spatial_var and
    ncd_put_time_slice. These encapsulate behavior that used to be duplicated in
    the code.

(4) Add mksurfdata_map unit tests using the new pfunit-based unit testing
    framework. However, I have NOT done a full migration of the mksurfdata_map
    unit tests. Thus, there are still some tests that use the old unit testing
    framework that I put in place (which leveraged the test stuff that Erik set
    up for csm_share a while ago). These tests can be migrated to pfunit
    incrementally: as someone touches code that is under test using the old
    framework, they could move the relevant tests into the new pfunit-based
    framework.

(5) Create new input datasets, based on the above changes:

    - new flanduse_timeseries files created because I have changed the
      information on these files

    - new surface datasets created because I introduced roundoff-level changes
      in the surface datasets, and so regenerated all surface datasets now in
      order to save someone a headache later.

    - new initial conditions files created so that out-of-the-box initial
      conditions will be compatible with the surface datasets, according to
      various consistency checks.

    See the following files in inputdata for documentation of how the new
    datasets were created:

    lnd/clm2/initdata_map/README_c141226

========= New object-oriented class for storing and operating on pct_pft
          data. Encapsulating a bunch of behavior in here allowed me to simplify
          other code. Before this, I was keeping track of two separate
          representations of pct_pft: First it was stored as % of grid cell,
          then it was later converted into % of landunit together with the
          landunit's % of grid cell. This was starting to get hard to manage,
          because certain operations could only be done on the first
          representation, and other operations could only be done on the second
          representation – and at some point in the processing pipeline, the
          conversion happened and the first representation was no longer
          usable. Now there is a single representation, and the class allows any
          desired operation to be performed on that single representation. This
          adds some complexity within the class, but removes complexity from the
          rest of the code, particularly mksurfdat.F90.
A       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mkpctPftTypeMod.F90

========= This new module contains routines that operate on both instances of
          pct_pft_type (pctnatpft and pctcft) at once. Thus, this contains
          higher-level logic than was appropriate for mkpctPftTypeMod. Yet, I
          wanted these routines in a separate module from mkpftMod as an aid to
          testing, since mkpftMod has a bunch of dependencies.
A       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mkpftUtilsMod.F90

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

========= Changes that take advantage of some of the other refactoring described
          here, plus add logic to allow input dataset to not contain crops even
          when generating a transient dataset for crops; also add PCT_CROP and
          PCT_CFT on the landuse_timeseries output file
M       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mkpftMod.F90

========= Changes that take advantage of some of the other refactoring described
          here, especially making use of the new pct_pft_type methods. Plus: (a)
          save pctcft from the initial input file so it can be used when
          generating landuse_timeseries, (b) remove unwanted landunit percents
          from the landuse_timeseries file, (c) add transient PCT_CROP and
          PCT_CFT, (d) complete rewrite of the code that normalizes pct_pft to
          account for special landunits: the code to handle urban was very
          confusing, and I hope this new code is at least a step towards being
          less confusing [this change introduces roundoff-level differences],
          (e) remove some error-checking code that is now embedded in the
          pct_pft_type routines
M       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mksurfdat.F90

========= Updated for new files
M       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/Srcfiles

========= Added two new routines: ncd_def_spatial_var and
          ncd_put_time_slice. These encapsulate behavior that used to be
          duplicated in the code. Also, moved convert_latlon from mkutilsMod to
          here, since it is really related to netcdf stuff.
M       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mkncdio.F90

========= Simplify this module significantly by using the new
          ncd_def_spatial_var. Also change what fields are present on the
          transient landuse file: remove some no-longer-desired fields (% of
          special landunits, etc.).
M       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mkfileMod.F90

========= Use new ncd_def_spatial_var

========= Delete routines that have been moved to a more appropriate place
M       models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/mksurfdata_map/src/mkutilsMod.F90

========= Remove tests from old test framework for code that I have deleted or
          migrated to my new modules; and fix some minor errors that appeared
          when runnng the old unit tests with gfortran.

========= Add logic needed for creating transient crop datasets. The main
          differences are (a) for crop, we create a year-2000 surface dataset
          together with the transient dataset (rather than a year-1850 surface
          dataset), and (b) we always use the non-crop transient raw data, even
          when creating a transient crop dataset.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: most clm4_5 runs
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

     Note that there were no source code changes in this tag, so the only
     differences come from differences in datasets (fsurdat,
     flanduse_timeseries, finidat).

     I confirmed that differences in fsurdat and flanduse_timeseries are
     generally roundoff-level. There are greater than roundoff-level diffs in
     PCT_NAT_PFT at a small number of points, but all of these points have
     PCT_NATVEG = 0 (this is due to a fix in how PCT_NAT_PFT is determined for
     points with 0% vegetated landunit, and > 0% urban); this would only affect
     dynamic landunit runs. Other than that, max normalized RMS diffs are 2e-8,
     and most are considerbly smaller.

     finidat files were created as one-offs to ensure that the only differences
     are in the subgrid weights, arising from these surface dataset differences.

One-line Summary: rework cold start initialization for transient runs

Purpose of changes:

  (1) Do not adjust subgrid weights (or set harvest variables) in cold start
      initialization. Instead, wait to do this until the first run step. The
      motivation for this is (a) this is consistent with what is done for
      glacier (for which prognostic weights aren't available until the run
      phase), and (b) it simplifies what needs to be done in initialization,
      particularly for transient crops (which are coming soon).

  (2) Do not run the biogeophys & biogeochem dyn subgrid conservation code in
      the first step of a cold start run. This affects the current operation of
      glacier, and is important in conjunction with (1): this avoids doing a
      large adjustment of physics or BGC caused by a fictitious change in area
      in the first time step after cold start.

    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      
      Changes answers only in initialization. This shows up as changes in the
      fields set to the coupler in initialization, and/or changes in the initial
      history file. In offline runs (I compsets), this change does not affect
      the simulation beyond initialization, but it is expected to change the
      evolution of the system in coupled runs. However, again note that this
      only affects cold start runs wth glacier and/or transient PFTs, which
      would not be typical for production runs.

CLM testing:

  Note: testing was done on ozone_polymorphism_n09_clm4_5_1_r098, which was
  before I put in place the abort if you're trying to run ozone with pgi. After
  that, I ran two tests with pgi (one with ozone and one without), and one test
  with intel (with ozone) in order to make sure that the abort check was put in
  properly. After all testing was complete, I reverted accidental whitespace
  changes in clm_initializeMod.F90 and restFileMod.F90 - I did not run any
  additional testing after reverting those whitespace changes.

  unit-tests (models/lnd/clm/src):

    yellowstone: ok

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45, with '-model_gen_comp clm2'):

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only): ok
    goldbach_nag: ok

  Also, ran these two additional tests, with comparisons to baselines - these
  are tests that I have replaced with new tests:

  ERS_Ly5.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-irrigOn_reduceOutput
  PET_P15x2_Ly3.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_pgi.clm-irrigOn_reduceOutput

One-line Summary: update externals to cesm1_3_beta14 or beyond

Purpose of changes:

   Update most externals to cesm1_3_beta14 or beyond. The one exception is mct,
   for which I had trouble accessing the tag at the location used in beta14, so
   I am sticking with the previous mct tag.

   Some notable changes:

   (1) update in intel compiler on yellowstone to intel15

   (2) robust fix for number of datm streams, using Sean Santos's dynamic vector

   (3) testmods reworked to use recursive testmods

   (4) unit_testing, CMake & Machines updated so that unit tests now work on
   yellowstone


Requirements for tag:

Test level of tag: regular

CLM testing:

  unit-tests (models/lnd/clm/src):

    yellowstone: ok

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45, with '-model_gen_comp clm2'):

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok
    yellowstone_gnu (clm45 only): ok
    goldbach_nag: ok

    Other than xFails, note that the following failed:

    *** presumably this failed in the previous tag, so baselines didn't exist
    BFAIL SMS_D.1x1_mexicocityMEX.I.goldbach_nag.compare_hist.clm4_5_1_r097 

    *** ozone tests that won't work until an upcoming tag that brings ozone in
    SFAIL ERS_D.f10_f10.I1850CLM45.goldbach_nag.clm-o3.GC.1128-0838.45.n
    SFAIL PET_P15x2_Ly3.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_pgi.clm-irrig_o3_reduceOutput.GC.1128-0838.45.p
    SFAIL ERS_Ly5.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-irrig_o3_reduceOutput.GC.1128-0838.45.i

    Also, note that the following test failed:

    FAIL  ERH_D.f19_g16.I1850CLM45CN.yellowstone_pgi.clm-drydepnomegan 

    This appears to be a scripts problem. Since Mariana wants to do away with
    ERH tests anyway, I just replaced this with:

    PASS  ERI_D.f19_g16.I1850CLM45CN.yellowstone_pgi.clm-drydepnomegan 


    Also ran the following two tests, which have been replaced with
    (currently-failing) o3 tests:

    ERS_Ly5.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_intel.clm-irrigOn_reduceOutput
    PET_P15x2_Ly3.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCCROP.yellowstone_pgi.clm-irrigOn_reduceOutput

    The PET test passed, but the ERS test failed (see bug 2091)

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_1_r097

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL
    - what platforms/compilers: yellowstone-intel
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
       NOT INVESTIGATED

       These diffs are presumably due to the yellowstone-intel compiler upgrade
       to v15.


   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: major refactorization to introduce new soilbiogeochem data
	types and routines that are independent of either ED or CN datatypes

Purpose of changes: Major refactorization to introduce new soilbiogeochem
  data types and permit ED and CN vegetation to be independent of each other
  AND both work with either the same soilbiogeochem or in the future 
  potentially different soilbiogeochem modules

Requirements for tag: None

Describe any changes made to build system: bld/configure modified to
  accomodate new directory structure - introduction of soilbiogeochem/ 
  directory

Describe any changes made to the namelist: None

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: None

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: Since use_cn and use_ed
  are now mutually exclusive, CN memory is not longer allocated when ED is run
  and the memory reduction (for f19_g16) seems to be about 50%.

       type(ed_phenology_type)                 :: ed_phenology_inst
       type(ed_clm_type)                       :: ed_clm_inst
    so now have ed_allsites_inst which is an array of sites (at this point allocated at the
    gridcell level - but that could easily be modified to be at some other level like the
    column level
(2) In EDTypesMod.F90 added method map_clmpatch_to_edpatch that
    maps a CLM vector patch to an ED linked-list patch - there is still 
    a one to one correspondence between an ED patch and a CLM vector patch. The
    call looks like the following
       currentPatch => map_clmpatch_to_edpatch(ed_allsites_inst(g), p) 

(3) In EDTypesMod.F90 added a ED Patch type-bound method set_root_fraction that computes
    the root fraction for an ED patch
(4) In EDTypes.F90 eliminated the following components of userdata
      type (site)  , pointer :: firstsite_pnt => null()         ! pointer to the first site in the system
      type (cohort), pointer :: storesmallcohort => null()      ! storage of the smallest cohort for insertion routine
      type (cohort), pointer :: storebigcohort => null()        ! storage of the largest cohort for insertion routine 
    These are no longer needed since the above pointers are now local variables 
    in EDCohortDynamics and EDPatchDynamics

One-line Summary: Several answer changing bug-fixes: snow grain size, lake hydrology, default settings, organic soil

Purpose of changes:

Bring in several bug-fixes most of which change answers.

Snow grain size bug that Mark Flanner discovered under snow layer combination. 
Lake hydrology fix from Zack Subin that would rarely cause the code to abort. Snow depth fix from
Sean Swenson. Use Priglent inversion as recommended by Charlie Koven. Correct population density for 2000 conditions
from 1850 to peroperly be 2000. Modify all Carbon on spinup from Dave Lawrenece. Add option to square or not square
the organic fraction (default is to square for clm4_5 and to NOT for clm5_0). Bug with pervious road that Keith
Oleson found. Simplify an if for urban to consistently use a double precision constant. Point to the new CLMNCEP_V5
dataset.

For clm4_0 rcp6 and rcp8.5 pftdyn datasets are updated for after 2005.

Some fixes that don't change answers. Get the Prigilent inversion and usephfact options working again.
Fix a bug in interp_source option that Sean Swenson found. Split out test datasets for getregional script since
the datasets all have to be at the same resolution as the domain file. Also read filelist rather than use env 
variables.

Requirements for tag: Fix the bugs below

Test level of tag: regular

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
                1934 -- snow grain size (both clm4_0 and clm4_5). Just fix on clm4_5 side.

Changes answers relative to baseline:  Yes!

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:   clm4_5 and clm5_0
    - what platforms/compilers:   all
    - nature of change (similar climate, except new clm5_0 feature)

   clm4_0 for rcp6 and rcp8.5 changes answers by using the new good wood harvest
   datasets for after 2005.

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: refactoring N comp by Jinyun Tang (LBL) and transpiration sink isolation by Gautam Bisht (LBL)

Purpose of changes: Bring in two refactorings:
	Jinyun Tang (LBL) - isolation of the routines to do soil nutrient
	competition dynamics into a module, and allow for different
	implementations through runtime polymorphism.

	Gautam Bisht (LBL) - new function to make transpiration sink
	distribution independent of subsurface flow physics

One-line Summary: misc. glacier-related updates

Purpose of changes:

(1) Add dlnd, satm and srof externals, so that TG compsets (CISM-only, forced by
    dlnd) can be run from a CLM tag. This will facilitate CISM development and
    testing.

(2) Remove CLM's dependence on the CISM grid. Previously, CLM used the CISM grid
    to determine which fglcmask file to use. But the differences between the
    fglcmask files were inconsequential (all of them included the full area of
    Greenland, which is what was important). I have created a new set of
    fglcmask files that are independent of the CISM grid, and point CLM to these
    new files. This will make it easier to add new CISM grids in the future,
    because no changes will be needed in CLM for this purpose. However, note
    that the use of these new files means that the number of virtual landunits &
    columns changes for glcmec runs.

(3) In subgridAveMod, fix c2l routines: change pft%wtlunit to col%wtlunit (bugz
    2077)

Requirements for tag:

Test level of tag: regular

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_1_r093

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: IG compsets - both CLM40 and CLM45
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
        only changes diagnostic cpl hist fields - no change in the simulation

        The changes arise from the new glcmask files, which exclude a few points
        from the glcmask that used to be included. These points are all outside
        of Greenland, so they are not important for coupling to CISM. However,
        it means that a few virtual columns have been removed. This, in turn,
        changes the values of some l2x topo, tsrf and qice fields sent to the
        coupler. But this does NOT feed back on the simulation in any way.
    
        Some tests also exhibit diffs in the CLM diagnostic fields PCT_GLC_MEC
        and QICE_FORC. Again, these are due to changes in where we have virtual
        columns, and do not affect the simulation.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: change cold-start snow initialization, update cism external

Purpose of changes:

(1) Change cold-start snow initialization logic. The original logic did
different snow initialization depending on whether we are inside or outside the
glcmask. That's a problem in that answers change depending on the glcmask. The
new logic instead uses a latitude threshold for determining where to initialize
a non-zero snow pack. Note that this will change answers for all cold-start
cases, including non-glcmec cases.

(2) Update CISM to version 2.

(2) Pull out the locally-created filters from CanopyFluxes and BareGroundFluxes
    into filterMod, in order to support pulling irrigation out of
    CanopyFluxes. This will also be needed to support pulling other hydrology
    stuff out of CanopyFluxes.

(3) Add unit tests for irrigation

(4) Rework some irrigation infrastruture, and add some more unit test utility
    routines

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone: not run

  unit-tests (models/lnd/clm/src):

    yellowstone: fail due to two issues:

      (1) The unit tests currently won't build on yellowstone due to an ICE that
      will probably be fixed when we remove dependencies of SoilStateType.

      (2) In addition, even once that's fixed, the yellowstone unit tests either
      need (a) a bump in the unit testing external (unit_testing_0_08) and
      Machines external (Machines_141007) (I didn't do that for my tag because
      it pulls in a bump in the intel compiler version to 14 rather than 13.1),
      or (b) the following diffs:

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_1_r089

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES (but only because of bug 1998)

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: irrigation
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change: larger than roundoff, not investigated closely

    The changes are entirely due to the btran bug (bug 1998): The old flow was:
      - compute btran
      - calculate irrigation (depends on btran)
      - hack btran for soybeans

    whereas the new flow is:
      - call CanopyFluxes: computes btran and hacks btran for soybeans
      - calculate irrigation (depends on btran)

    I have confirmed that answers are bit-for-bit for both irrigation tests (for
    both cpl and clm hist files), when I introduce the following diffs in both
    the trunk and the branch:

Tag name:  clm4_5_1_r089
Originator(s):  erik (Erik)
Date: Mon Oct 13 13:46:43 MDT 2014
One-line Summary: Bring new urban building temperature to trunk as a clm5.0 feature 
                  as well as human-stress index calculations

Purpose of changes:

New prognostic internal building air temperature methodology for CLM5.0. Retain the older simpler method
for CLM4.5. The namelist toggle to switch between them is: building_temp_method. By default for clm4_5 physics
the older method is used and for clm5_0 the newer one is used. Also add in a package of human-stress index
calculations. Again this is by default on for clm5_0 and off for clm4_5. 

The new building air temperature methodology, solves the system of equations for internal: air, roof, floor, 
and wall (shade and sunlit) Temperatures. It uses the LAPACK subroutine DGESV to solve the system. It also
figures out the energy flux needed to either cool the building air temperature to a maximum allowed temperature
or to heat it to the minimum allowed temperature.

Add in the new load balancing tool and the PyReshaper tool (changes multi-variable 
monthly history files into single-variable time-series files).

Remove the now unneeded clm4_5 interpinic as well as the mkmapgrids FORTRAN program.

Requirements for tag: Bring in new clm5_0 building temperature as option, Fix scripts bugs, bug 2053/2032

One-line Summary: Pull out ED deps. in TemperatureTypeMod, can now compile with pgi 14.7

Purpose of changes:  Pull out the dependency on EDBioType in TemperatureType.F90.  The ED
variables related to phenology now reside in EDPhenologyMod.F90.  This refactor also had
the effect of getting past a PGI 14.7 ICE which looks like it was due to the use of EDbio_vars
in TemperatureType.F90.  When I pulled out lines 1227 and 1226 of biogeophys/TemperatureType.F90
(in clm4_5_1_r087) and passed the two EDbio_vars variables through the argument list the ICE 
went away.

This tag breaks ED restart tests.  We went ahead with the tag because we had to fix a more 
general problem with the CESM and CAM builds and PGI 14.7.  the ED v0.1.0 branch does not
have these modifications and may be used as an alternative.  A new clm tag will shortly
follow that addresses any remaining problems.

One-line Summary: Fix two balance check errors, and turn abort for balance check back on to appropriate levels

Purpose of changes:

Fix two balance check errors that were causing problems for simulations. Also some of the balance check aborts
were turned off in clm4_5_1_r082, so turn them back on again. Tighten water balance error from 1.e-4 to 1.e-5.
Tighten LW, surface-flux and solar radiation balance errors from 1.e-3 to 1.e-5 and add warning for 1.e-7.
Turn surface-flux balance and soil balance check errors abort back on. Soil balance tightened to 1.e-4 (from 1.e-3)
with warnings shown at 1.e-6.

Also bring in an update to PTCLM, and allow tools tester to be submitted to geyser or caldera. Just as an aside
as something that was already done.

One-line Summary: replace conditionals with polymorphism for soil water retention curve

Purpose of changes:

The main motivation for this tag was the need to introduce a
soil_suction_inverse routine, which will be used for irrigation. It is important
that soil_suction_inverse remains consistent with soil_suction for every soil
water retention curve method. In talking with Ben Andre and Erik, we felt the
best way to ensure this consistency was to have a separate, small module for
each soil retention curve method. We felt the best way to implement this was via
polymorphism. Polymorphism is arguably overkill in this simple case, but we
thought it would be good to convert it to polymorphism partly as an example that
we and others can follow in more complex cases where it will provide greater
benefit.

To add a new soil retention curve method:

   (1) Create a module similar to
   SoilWaterRetentionCurveClappHornberg1978Mod.F90
   
   (2) Modify the select case statement in SoilWaterRetentionCurveFactoryMod.F90
   so that it is able to create an instance of your new type

Note that this refactor also combines the soil_suction and soil_hk
parameterization options into a single option. Dave Lawrence and Rosie Fisher
felt that was preferable, and Jinyun Tang was okay with this.

One-line Summary: make glc_dyn_runoff_routing spatially-varying, based on input from glc

Purpose of changes:

Dave Lawrence, Bill Lipscomb and Jeremy Fyke have pointed out that
glc_dyn_runoff_routing needs to be spatially-varying: Even when we're coupling
to CISM, we should continue to use the old scheme in regions that don't have an
active icesheet model underneath (which currently includes Antarctica and all of
the world's smaller glaciers - i.e., everything except Greenland). Furthermore,
we have introduced a new ability into CISM to run in diagnostic mode, without
sending calving/runoff fluxes to the coupler. In this case, too, CLM should
revert to using the old scheme (glc_dyn_runoff_routing = .false.).

To accomplish both of these things, I have introduced a new coupling field,
through which GLC tells CLM which areas have an icesheet that is "active" in the
sense of sending fluxes to the coupler. In this CLM tag, CLM sets a
spatially-varying version of glc_dyn_runoff_routing based on this new coupler
field - replacing the old, namelist-settable version of this flag.

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone: ok (baseline comparisons fail for clm45 & clm50, as expected)

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45, with '-model_gen_comp clm2'):

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok
    yellowstone_gnu: NOT RUN
    goldbach_nag: ok
    goldbach_intel: ok

    Note: Most testing was run on glc_runoff_routing_n06_clm4_5_1_r083. After
    that tag, I added the following write statement in restFileMod, as a
    workaround for a PGI compiler bug:

       write(iulog,*) 'about to call aerosol_vars%restart: ', ubound(waterstate_vars%h2osoi_ice_col)    

    After that addition, I just reran a subset of tests: 6 yellowstone-intel
    tests, 10 yellowstone-pgi tests (including the 2 that had failed due to the
    compiler bug), and 5 goldbach-nag tests. 

NOTE: Unit test build is currently failing due to a change in r082. Stefan is
working on a fix.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_1_r083

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 with CISM (i.e., IG)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

    (1) Large changes in runoff from glaciers in IG compsets, due to setting
    glc_dyn_runoff_routing to .false. outside of Greenland.

    (2) Roundoff-level changes in icemask for some resolutions and compilers,
    due to changes in the cism external.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? For icemask changes: examined cprnc RMS errors. For other
   changes, diffs are greater than roundoff.

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

CLM testing:

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45, with '-model_gen_comp clm2'):

    WJS: note: Stef told me that he actually ran all the yellowstone tests, and
    all were okay

    goldbach_intel    - 40 OK, 45 OK

Note 1:  Due to the fact that in older baselines component_gen_comp was failing due to a scripts error (now fixed)
some older baselines don't have the clm history files.  As one example:

   BFAIL ERI_D.f10_f10.ICRUCLM50BGC.goldbach_intel.clm-reduceOutput.compare_hist.clm4_5_1_r082 
   - rerun.  compare against clm4_5_1_r081, then it passes.

   PASS  ERI_D.f10_f10.ICRUCLM50BGC.goldbach_intel.clm-reduceOutput.memleak
   PASS  ERI_D.f10_f10.ICRUCLM50BGC.goldbach_intel.clm-reduceOutput.compare_hist.clm4_5_1_r082_oldPgi

   PASS ERI_D.f10_f10.ICRUCLM50BGC.goldbach_intel.clm-reduceOutput.C.140917-082253.nlcomp

   For these tests, I made sure that clm2 history files were in the clm4_5_1_r083 baseline dirs.  They
   should pass going forward.

Tag name:  clm4_5_1_r081
Originator(s):  mvertens (Mariana Vertenstein)
Date: Sun Aug 24 19:39:50 MDT 2014
One-line Summary: major infrastructure changes and directory reorganization under src

Purpose of changes:

   Overview of previous code design
   ==========================================
   - data structures arranged by subgrid type (pps, cps, lps, grc)
   - all functional categorization lumped in that one subgrid type which led to
   - centralization rather than modularization of all data
   - definition and instantiation in ONE big module (clmtype.F90)
   - allocation and initialization in ONE big module (clmtypeInitMod.F90)
   - history variables all in ONE big module (histFldsMod.F90)
   - restart variables in effectively TWO big modules (biogeophysicsRestMod.F90 and CNRestMod.F90)
   - time constant initialization in ONE complex module (initTimeConst.F90)
   - time varying cold start initialization in ONE module (initColdMod.F90)
   - accumulation variables in ONE module (accumulMod.F90)

   Overview of new code design
   ==========================================
   data structures arranged by scientific functional categories
     (e.g. temperature_type, waterstate_type, energyflux_type, etc)
   - a given data structure now contains ALL subgrid levels are in the data structure -
     and variables in the data structure are now appended with a unique suffix to
     indicate their subgrid levels (new suffixes: _patch, _col, _lun, _grc)
   - this does NOT effect the science code base, ONLY the associate statements
   - there are separate module for each data type definition
     (e.g. TemperatureType.F90, WaterstateType.F90, EnergyFluxType.F90, etc)
   - each data type has associated methods for
     - Allocation:
       variables now initialized as NaNs upon allocation
     - Cold Start Initialization:
       cold start initialization of variables is now ALWAYS done
       and overwritten if finidat is read in as spun up dataset (also now
       have on line interpolation of initial conditions as part of this refactor as well)
     - History initialization of variables
       All history fields now initialized as spval
     - Restart initialization of variables
     - Accumulation Initialization 
       initialization and accumulation update of variables
   - Instantiation of datatypes is now separate from their declaration
     (for now in clm_initialize.F90 - will be moved in the future)

   Centralized routines that no longer exist:
   ==========================================
   Data types  	  : clmtype.F90, clmtypeInitMod.F90
   Initialization : initTimeConst.F90, initCold.F90
   History	  : histFldsMod.F90
   Accumulation	  : accumulMod.F90
   Restart        : biogeophysRestMod.F90, CNRestMod.F90
   Biogeochemistry: CNSetValue.F90

   Instantiation of Types

2) Public Types:

   - the following are public types that can BE PASSED AS ARGUMENTS 
   - the type instances FOR NOW are clm_initialized and then used by the driver
   - this will be generalized in the future	

  type(ch4_type)              :: ch4_vars
  type(carbonstate_type)      :: carbonstate_vars
  type(carbonstate_type)      :: c13_carbonstate_vars
  type(carbonstate_type)      :: c14_carbonstate_vars
  type(carbonflux_type)       :: carbonflux_vars
  type(carbonflux_type)       :: c13_carbonflux_vars
  type(carbonflux_type)       :: c14_carbonflux_vars
  type(nitrogenstate_type)    :: nitrogenstate_vars
  type(nitrogenflux_type)     :: nitrogenflux_vars
  type(dgvs_type)             :: dgvs_vars
  type(crop_type)             :: crop_vars

  type(soilhydrology_type)    :: soilhydrology_vars
  type(solarabs_type)         :: solarabs_vars
  type(surfalb_type)          :: surfalb_vars
  type(surfrad_type)          :: surfrad_vars
  type(temperature_type)      :: temperature_vars
  type(urbanparams_type)      :: urbanparams_vars
  type(waterflux_type)        :: waterflux_vars
  type(waterstate_type)       :: waterstate_vars
  type(atm2lnd_type)          :: atm2lnd_vars

  type(lnd2atm_type)          :: lnd2atm_vars
  type(lnd2glc_type)          :: lnd2glc_vars
  type(glc_diagnostics_type)  :: glc_diagnostics_vars
  type(EDbio_type)            :: EDbio_vars

  - private Types (now som modules have their own PRIVATE types) 
 
   DUSTMod.F90       :    type(dust_type)     
   VOCEmissionMod.F90:    type(vocemis_type)  
   ch4Mod.F90        :    type(ch4_type)      

   API Changes:
   ==========================================
   Original APIs:
   clmtype was in effect a global common block and all routines had use statements into it
   difficult to track any intent or flow through system
   difficult to set up functional unit testing (.e.g. CanopyFluxesMod.F90, etc)
	
   Refactorized APIs:
   all new datatype instances are passed as arguments
   science code is effectively the same since only the associate statements have been modified

   New Directory Structure under clm/
   ==========================================
   bld/
   doc/	
   src/biogeochem/
   src/biogeophys/
   src/cpl/
   src/dyn_subgrid/
   src/ED/
   src/ED/biogeochem

   src/unit_test_mocks/
   src/unit_test_shr/
   src/utils/
   src_clm4_0/
   test/
   tools/  	
	
   Advantages of refactorization:
   ==========================================
   - Lets compiler enforce intent attributes
   - Makes functional unit testing easier since module drivers can be
     constructed with relevant mock data more easily
   - Makes more sense scientifically since now easier to extend code logic as
     to where you want to introduce new variables
   - Easier to maintain code since code flow is easier to follow and to modify
   - Easy to move variables around from one data type to another since now
     know everything that is logically connected to that variable that
     needs to be moved Offers new modularity for trading in and out new
     formulations of targeted functionality

CLM testing:

    goldbach_nag      yes
    goldbach_intel    yes
    goldbach_pgi      yes

    NOTE for goldbach_nag - four ED compare_hist tests fail with small bit for bit differences. 
    In fact - looking more closely, these tests are also run for pgi and intel on goldbach - and
    values for 	LITTER_IN and LITTER_OUT are 0. for those compilers but non-zero for nag.
    With the refactoring code - those fields are again 0. for intel and pgi - but totally different
    and non-zero for nag. Apparently, this is known problem that will get resolved in when new ED changes
    are brount in

One-line Summary: Add lai stream capability and the ability to run with V5 cruncep data.  Code written by swenson, 
modified and tested by muszala.

Purpose of changes: Add lai stream capability with use_lai_streams namelist variable.  Also add a datm_mode option
s.t. we can use cruncep V5 data if a user wants.  Move anomaly focing code out of CLM and into DATM.

One-line Summary: Answer changes for fire code from Fang Li

Purpose of changes:

Several changes to CN Fire model. Some fixes for non-transient, as well as limiting of fire for high tropical
forest coverage. Change some units from per time-step to per second. Change Lightning input dataset from just
cloud to ground to total lightning. Some fire parameters were also changed and re-tuned for Qian forcing.
Some more documentation on fire fields was added.

When -ed_mode is sent to CLM build-namelist, a particular ED params dataset is used over the default. Make
a simple change that allows ED to run when CN is off. Add a 1850 and transient 20thC and rcp=8.5 datasets
for 1x1_brazil.

Requirements for tag: Fix bugs 1805 and 1719, lower fire amount in amazon

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons:  clm4_5_75

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CN and BGC with CLM4.5 physics
          CLM4.0 for all modes, and CLM4.5 with SP or ED should be identical
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: new climate

   Fang Li, ran simulations with Qian forcing on yellowstone and tuned fire parameters to that forcing.
   However, her simulations had a minor bug in the conversion of total lightning to just cloud-to-ground
   (latitude in degree's was used for a cosine, rather than latitude in radians -- see bug 1996).

One-line Summary: update externals to rtm1_0_38 and esmf_wrf_timemgr_140529

Purpose of changes: update externals to rtm1_0_38 and esmf_wrf_timemgr_140529.  These modifications
are based on valgrind errors that orginated in src/riverroute.  Tested in clm4_5_72 to make sure
everything was still BFB (at least w.r.t. CLM testing).  Retested (results below) against clm4_5_73.

CLM testing:

in addition to other clm tests I updated the rtm and esmf externals in cesm1_3_alpha09c and
ran two B cases.

Note:  There is one ED test (SMS_D_Mmpi-serial.5x5_amazon.ICLM45CNED.goldbach_nag.clm-edTestGb) that failed for me in my
testing but passed for Bill with the same checkout.  We will keep an eye on this, but it's not super-critical at the moment.
Differences are very small in cpl. voc fields (largest RMS difference is 1e-13).

Originator(s):  sacks (sacks)
Date: Wed May 28 16:05:36 MDT 2014
One-line Summary: misc. bfb changes - see detailed summary below

Purpose of changes:

  (1) Rename fpftdyn to flanduse_timeseries, and make related changes to names
      throughout the code. This rename is in preparation for an upcoming tag
      where this file will take on more general uses (e.g., transient crop
      areas).

  (2) Decrease thresholds for water, snow and energy balance checks (these were
      too permissive)

  (3) Move stuff out of clm_varcon into landunit_varcon (for constants specific
      to CLM's landunits) and column_varcon (for constants specific to CLM's
      columns) - analogous to the existing pftvarcon

  (4) Move some routines out of initGridCellsMod into a new initSubgridMod

  (5) Make time_info a public member of dyn_file_type, which allows removing a
      bunch of delegation methods. And rename some things in time_info_type for
      clarity.

  (6) Rework metadata for the description of landunit, column and pft types
      on the history and restart files, to centralize these descriptions to the
      appropriate place in the code.

  (7) Add general-purpose functionality for setting up subgrid structure for
      unit tests

  (8) Move unit tests into source tree, rather than being in
      test/unit_testers. Now the top-level script is in models/lnd/clm/src.

  (9) Fix baseline comparisons for PTCLM tests

Requirements for tag: N/A

          (see detailed notes above)
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/initGridCellsMod.F90

========= Make time_info a public member of dyn_file_type. This allows us to
          remove all methods from dyn_file_type (which were just delegating
          responsibility to time_info_type). Also rename some methods and
          variables in time_info_type.

========= Rework metadata for the description of landunit, column and pft types
          on the history and restart files. Point is to centralize the
          definition of these different types as much as possible (rather than,
          e.g., having restFileMod know about the translation between landunit
          indices and names). For the history file, I am removing the metadata
          from the PCT_LANDUNIT long name, instead putting it in global
          metadata, as is done for the restart file.

CLM testing:

  Most testing done on dynlu_crops_n01_addclm50bld_n06_clm4_5_72; PTCLM and
  tools testing done on dynlu_crops_n03_addclm50bld_n06_clm4_5_72

  Note that the branch was up-to-date with addclm50bld_n06_clm4_5_72; this is
  identical to clm4_5_73 except for a fix to the build-namelist tests (see below)

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone: ok
      compared against addclm50bld_n06_clm4_5_72 (essentially clm4_5_73)
      expected diffs for transient cases

      The following tests also failed when comparing the baseline against
      itself (NOTE: this is apparently fixed in clm4_5_73):

      466/497 < FAIL> <Test Id: 466> <Desc: compare file lnd_in DNE for phys-crop.clm4_5 and -res+1.9x2.5+-irrig+.true.+-crop+-bgc+cn++-envxml_dir+.>  
      467/497 < FAIL> <Test Id: 467> <Desc: compare file temp_file.txt DNE for phys-crop.clm4_5 and -res+1.9x2.5+-irrig+.true.+-crop+-bgc+cn++-envxml_dir+.>  
      496/497 < FAIL> <Test Id: 496> <Desc: compare file lnd_in DNE for phys-crop.clm5_0 and -res+1.9x2.5+-irrig+.true.+-crop+-bgc+cn++-envxml_dir+.>  
      497/497 < FAIL> <Test Id: 497> <Desc: compare file temp_file.txt DNE for phys-crop.clm5_0 and -res+1.9x2.5+-irrig+.true.+-crop+-bgc+cn++-envxml_dir+.>  

  regular tests (aux_clm40, aux_clm45, with '-model_gen_comp clm2'):

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok
    goldbach_nag: ok
    goldbach_intel: ok
    goldbach_pgi: ok

      Most comparisons were done against clm4_5_72.

      These comparisons failed due to a problem with component_gen_comp and the
      SSP test; manual comparisons show these to be identical to Erik's tests (for
      clm4_5_73):

        FAIL SSP.f19_g16.I1850CLM45BGC.yellowstone_pgi.clm-default.GC.0520-2021.45.p.clm2.h0.compare_hist.clm4_5_72 
        FAIL SSP.f19_g16.I1850CLM45BGC.yellowstone_pgi.clm-default.GC.0520-2021.45.p.clm2.h1.compare_hist.clm4_5_72     

      For new tests added in Erik's upcoming tag (clm4_5_73), I did manual
      comparisons against Erik's baselines (cpl & clm hist for the yellowstone
      tests, just cpl for goldbach tests) - all PASS.

      Note that CLM hist files were NOT compared for any goldbach tests, because
      there were no CLM hist file baselines for clm4_5_72.

  tools testing:

    yellowstone interactive: ok

      Compared against addclm50bld_n06_clm4_5_72 (essentially clm4_5_73)

      Failures in the following baseline comparisons, due to changed name of output
      file (surfdata.pftdyn -> landuse.timeseries). Manual comparisons showed the
      output files to be identical in all cases:

      010 bl754 TBLtools.sh clm4_0 mksurfdata_map tools__s namelist ...................................\c
       rc=7 FAIL

      040 blfg4 TBLscript_tools.sh shared PTCLM PTCLMmkdata PTCLM_USUMB_Global_clm4_5^buildtools ......\c
       rc=7 FAIL

       Other than that, all tests & baseline comparisons passed

One-line Summary: Add the stub ability for clm5_0 physics to CLM build system

Purpose of changes:

Add phys=clm5_0 as an option to the build. Currently, nothing is different in the code, this just
adds the capability to do clm5_0 as a seperate configuration. The one thing that is different between
clm4_5 and clm5_0 is the setting of urban_hac.

Fix several issues needed for CAM: problem in DryDeposition (reoccurance of bug 1883, that was fixed and then
unfixed in clm4_5_48), fix for internal compiler errors. CAM has been using the branch version of this
since: cam5_3_29.

Work on updates for PTCLM. Add some new sites for Rosie and Jinyun. Correct the call to mkmapdata.sh.
Have CLM1PT forcing directory to use DIN_LOC_ROOT_CLMFORC so you can point it to a location seperate
from DIN_LOC_ROOT. Add a new support script to PTCLM to submit a list of sites to batch: PTCLMsublist.
Also allow release_tags in version find. Get buildtools to work on edison/hopper.

Get tools to work on hopper and edison, and update mapping to use ESMF6.3.0.

Fix various bugs: internal compiler error on janus, trigger an error if user_datm.streams.txt file is 
                  readonly (rather than hang). Use DIN_LOC_ROOT_CLMFORC for CLM1PT.

Requirements for tag: Fix bug 1883 and 1985 for Cheryl and CAM, fix PTCLM, add clm5_0, tools on hopper/edison

Test level of tag: regular

One-line Summary: Introduce code for Ecosystem Demography (CLM(ED)) Model

Purpose of changes: Introduce code for Ecosystem Demography (CLM(ED)) Model - first functional tag.

A large chunk of this code was written and re-written by Rosie Fisher.

"Introduce code for Ecosystem Demography (CLM(ED)) Model.  Adds capability to allow plant functional
types to compete for light, to represent recovery from disturbance, and to allow disturbances
(i.e. fire) to only afflict some fraction of the canopy, and to represent vegetation at the scale
of cohorts of trees. Note that this is a large change and includes:

1. Significant alterations to canopy albedo and surface radiation calculations
2. New photosynthesis scheme, based on existing science but to allow for more complex canopy structure
3. Introduction of a new allocation and growth scheme, (no consistent with that in CLM(CN)
4. Removal, for now, of Nitrogen limitation capabilities
5. Introduction of the SPITFIRE fire model, which interacts with ED via it's representation of
   size-structured mortality and removal of litter pools. 
6. Introduction of a simple seed bank model to allow persistence of vegetation through fire events.
7. For ED compsets there exists a cohort dimension on the restart files.

Cold starts and restarts work for the following.  The 1x1_brazil is the most heavily tested case both from 
science and SE standpoint:

1x1_brazil.ICLM45CNED.yellowstone_[intel | pgi]
5x5_amazon.ICLM45CNED.yellowstone_[intel | pgi]
1x1_brazil.ICLM45CNED.goldbach_[nag | intel | pgi ]
5x5_amazon.ICLM45CNED.goldbach_[nag | intel | pgi ]

Cold starts work for:

f10_f10.ICLM45CNED.yellowstone_[intel | pgi].
f19_g16.ICLM45CNED.yellowstone_[intel | pgi]

Code Origins:

The ED code in CLM is originally based on code by Moorcroft (www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/moorcroft/code_and_data/index.html)
and has been heavily modified in regards to both scientific implementation and assumptions.  Fom a software engineering
perspective, ED was rewritten from C into F2003 and the structure of the code has been significantly altered to fit into
the CESM/CLM framework.

The SPITFIRE code is based on (http://www.biogeosciences.net/7/1991/2010/bg-7-1991-2010.pdf) and has been significantly 
altered and extended to fit into the CESM/CLM framework.

Other points:
   1. removed many unused variables and module uses as reported by nag
	2. changing text wrapping on comments so they end at 139 characters
   3. changed many text based logical operators (.ne., .lt., .ge.) with their math. equivlanet (/=, > , <=)

Describe any changes made to build system:  ED functionality brought in.  Does not change existing
configurations.  For ED, there are now a CNED and BGCED compset.  Use CNED until BGC issues are worked
out.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: ED functionality brought in.  Does not change existing
configurations.  For ED compsets, there are two new namelist variables.  They are:

use_ed = .true.
use_ed_spit_fire = .true.

use_ed_spit_fire is set to true by default if use_ed is on.  Unless you are running our ED tests, you will
have to change your user_nl_clm to something like:

paramfile ='/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/lnd/clm2/edParams/CLMPARAMS_ED_011514.nc'
finidat = ''
hist_mfilt             = 365
hist_nhtfrq            = -24

hist_empty_htapes = .true.

hist_fincl1='NPP','GPP','BTRAN','TOTVEGC','H2OSOI','TLAI','LITTER_IN','LITTER_OUT',

'PFTleafbiomass','FIRE_ROS','WIND','TFC_ROS','DISPVEGC','AREA_TREES','AREA_PLANT' 

If on goldbach, use:

paramfile ='/fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm2/edParams/CLMPARAMS_ED_011514.nc'

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: N/A.  

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Ben Andre, and Erik Kluzek. Discussion of code review included Dave Lawrence, Forrest Hoffmann
and Ryan Knox.

List any svn externals directories updated (csm_share, mct, etc.): 

Changed externals to a branch_tag that supports ED compsets.  We are using branch_tags because trunk
scripts does not work with all of the current CLM tests:

One-line Summary: 2-way feedbacks for glacier, veg columns compute glacier SMB, and related changes

Purpose of changes:

  (1) Bring in two-way feedbacks for glacier when coupled to CISM, via dynamic
      landunits, so that CLM's glacier area remains consistent with CISM's
      glacier area. Also update CLM's glacier topography to be consistent with
      CISM. 

  (2) Add an elevation class "0", which provides surface mass balance over the
      vegetated portion of the grid cell. This is used to achieve glacial
      inception in CISM. Along with this change, also (a) set the topographic
      height of non-glacier areas based on bare land topography from CISM, and
      (b) change the downscaling of atmospheric fields so that they are also
      downscaled over vegetated columns within CISM's ice mask, to achieve
      greater consistency between what's happening in the glacier and vegetated
      portions of CISM's domain. (Note that, because longwave radiation is
      normalized, downscaling it over the vegetated column also changes answers
      over glacier columns.) These changes were primarily from Jeremy Fyke.

  (3) Rework some consistency checks to play nicely with dynamic landunits.

  (4) Rework unit test build to use libraries for the clm source and csm_share source

  (5) Misc. other changes, as noted below.

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone: ok

  regular tests

    NOTE: Most tests were done on bare_land_smb_n15_clm4_5_70, which did NOT
    include r59820 (add a comma in histFileMod to fix a syntax error caught by
    nag). After r59820, reran all goldbach_nag tests, plus one goldbach_pgi and
    one goldbach_intel.

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok
    goldbach_nag: ok
    goldbach_intel: ok
    goldbach_pgi: ok

  component_gen_comp on yellowstone_intel & yellowstone_pgi: ok

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_69 (clm4_5_68 for a few tests
   with missing baselines in clm4_5_69)

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All IG compsets (i.e., GLC compsets)
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
         New Climate

   Changes are:

     (1) All IG compsets (clm4.0 & clm4.5) change due to new CISM external

     (2) In addition, IG compsets with CLM4.5 change further due to:
         (a) 2-way feedbacks (CLM updated to match CISM)
         (b) downscaling done over vegetated landunits within the icemask

     (3) Also, the QSNWCPICE_NODYNLNDUSE history diagnostic field changes for
         ALL CLM4.5 runs, due to fixing bug 1969.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: bring in SHR_ASSERT macros

Purpose of changes: bring in SHR_ASSERT macros for Santos.

Add: #include "shr_assert.h" to source files
Remove: use shr_assert_mod    , only : shr_assert

then replace "call shr_assert" with SHR_ASSERT_ALL when asserting more than one dim

-    call shr_assert((ubound(carr) == (/bounds%endc/)), errMsg(__FILE__, __LINE__))
+    SHR_ASSERT_ALL((ubound(parr) == (/bounds%endp/)), errMsg(__FILE__, __LINE__))

and use SHR_ASSERT when asserting one dimen

-    call shr_assert(bounds%level == BOUNDS_LEVEL_CLUMP, errMsg(__FILE__, __LINE__))
+    SHR_ASSERT(bounds%level == BOUNDS_LEVEL_CLUMP, errMsg(__FILE__, __LINE__))

M       SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES

CLM testing:

Tested with two sets of externals because:

The old scripts do not allow any PGI tests to run while the new scripts have various issues
with ERI tests and selected PGI tests plus nag debug runs (fixed in a more recent machines tag).

By running with two sets of externals, I am confident that the source mods for SHR_ASSERT are
working correctly.  When CLM gets updates in scripts and machines, these will be updated in 
later tags.

I) Those included in this tag
II) Those that are a part of cesm1_3_alpha09b (only tested clm45).

  build-namelist tests: N/A

  regular tests: for (I) above:

    yellowstone_intel - OK - component_comp_gen - OK
    goldbach_nag      - OK
    goldbach_intel    - OK

  regular tests: for (II) above:

1) Yellowstone + Intel :  all ERI tests are completing ref1 and ref2 but die a silent death in the base case.  Erik looks like you changed Testlists, so the two VIC tests might be expected.

One-line Summary: start unit testing build-namelist

Purpose of changes: start doing unit testing on construction of the clm namelist.
This involved moving the contents of build-namelist into CLMBuildNamelist.pm and
bringing in perl infrastructure to supplement Test::More. Initial test suites are
implented for several name list variables.

One-line Summary: Update scripts to version that turns on transient CO2 streams for 
                  transient compsets, and update CISM (changes answers)

Purpose of changes:

Bring in the scripts version that by default had transient CO2 for any transient 
compsets. You can still turn it off by setting DATM_CO2_TSERIES=FALSE in env_run.xml. 
Also bring in the latest CISM version that has answer changes for any IG compsets.
It fixes fields sent from CISM to the coupler (fixes an exact restart problem).

Requirements for tag:
   update scripts and CISM, transient and IG compsets have different answers

One-line Summary: refactoring of initialization and introduction of run-time finidat interpolation

Purpose of changes: refactoring of initialization and introduction of run-time finidat interpolation

Completely rewrote clm_initialize to leverage new initialization scheme
In the new scheme, cold start initialization is ALWAYS called and values
are overwritten by either an appropriate finidat file OR by calling 
finidat_interp to interplate finidat to the output resolution/mask.

Requirements for tag:

Test level of tag: regular, short, tools, build_namelist, doc

Describe any changes made to build system:

    NONE	 

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   - ALL clm4.5 finidat files have been updated to contain new metadata that will enable the
     online interpinic to operate on them. The time stamp on all new files has the date c140111.
     The files have been created so that they are bit-for-bit compatible with the code base.
   - The following new namelist variables have been added to the namelist_definition_clm4_5.xml file
       - finidat_interp_source 
         if non-blank, then interpinic will be called to interpolate finidat_interp_source and 
         create output file specified by finidat_interp_dest.
       - finidat_interp_dest  
         if finidat_interp_source is set to non-blank, then interpinic will be called 
         to interpolate finidat_interp_source and create output file finidat_interp_dest

One-line Summary: Turn off MEGAN vocs when crops is running

Purpose of changes:

MEGAN does not currently work with prognostic crops. It needs a table of pft-specific values, and that this table has only been created for the 16 "standard" (non-crop) pfts.

Date: Wed Feb 19 09:19:40 MST 2014
One-line Summary: fix and clean ncdio_pio.F90.in.  clean clm_time_manager.  update externals.

Purpose of changes:

Note 1: This is the last tag that is tested on frankfurt; new tests are on goldbach.

Note 2: Pts. mode is being deprecated for science use as of this tag.  Use PTCLM.  Pts. mode
   remains in place in our test system.

Note 3: There is an unresolved problem with higher resolutions when dov2xy is .false. and we are
   using pnetcdf.  Please see bug 1730.

ncdio_pio.F90.in - fix initialization problem where count and start are sometimes used without
   being set.
clm_time_manager - clean out unused variables
update externals to support ED compsets, move pts. mode tests to testmods.  Update Machines and
   pio to address bug 1730.

One-line Summary: add some code needed for dynamic landunits; activate 0-weight veg landunit sometimes

Purpose of changes:

(1) Add grc%landunit_indices(:,:), so you can find a given l index if you have
    the g index (this will be needed in a few places for dynamic landunits)

(2) Add code to update landunit weights; currently has no effect because
    landunit areas don't change yet

(3) Refactor logic in the is_active_X routines, and add logic to activate a
    virtual vegetated landunit under some conditions (needed for coupling with
    CISM, and helpful for dynamic landunits). Specifically, we activate a
    virtual (0-weight) vegetated landunit for any grid cell that is NOT 100%
    istice (i.e., standard glacier) (we exclude grid cells that are 100% istice
    to avoid the performance penalty, because these aren't used for coupling
    with CISM, and the only way this glacier can retreat is if another landunit,
    like crop, increases there, which will rarely happen).

   Performance about 6% worse for clm4.5 IG runs at f09 (i.e., with glcmec),
   because of the new virtual vegetated columns. Not investigated for f19 or
   T31, but probably a similar performance hit.

   There were also a few memcomp failures

CLM testing:

  regular tests (aux_clm):

    NOTE: frankfurt intel & pgi ran on a slightly older version of the branch
    (dynlu_weight_updates_glacier_n05_clm4_5_62, which did not include some
    final minor refactoring to reweightMod); frankfurt nag & yellowstone
    intel/pgi ran on the final version

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok
    frankfurt_intel: ok
    frankfurt_pgi: ok
    frankfurt_nag: ok

  history file comparison with component_gen_comp and summarize_cprnc_diffs:

    yellowstone_intel: ok
    yellowstone_pgi: ok

    A bunch of expected failures in h1 (1-d) hist files, due to the newly-active
    points.


  Also: Did a manual test to show that answers are the same for virtual
  vegetated columns as they would be if the column had non-zero weight (to
  ensure there are no dependencies on whether a column's weight is non-zero).

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_62 for yellowstone (but
clm4_5_61 for component_gen_comp); clm4_5_61 for frankfurt

Changes answers relative to baseline: NO

   However, note diffs in 1-d hist files due to newly-active points.

One-line Summary: Get PTCLM working robustly, US-UMB test working, add CO2 streams to datm, add more 
                  consistency testing between compsets and user settings

Purpose of changes:

US-UMB fix in scripts and datm update. Fix so build-namelist will abort if there is an inconsistency with CLM_BLDNML_OPTS 
and user_nl_clm. Add CO2 streams as a built-in option to datm. Turn CO2 streams on with the DATM_CO2_TSERIES env_run.xml
variable. Can be set to: none,20tr,rcp2.6,rcp4.5,rcp6.0,rcp8.5, by default is none.

Requirements for tag:

   datm -- CO2 update, streams improvements
   Fix build-namelist consistency issues

One-line Summary: add 3-d snow history fields; continue harvest past end of pftdyn timeseries

Purpose of changes:

   There are two separate sets of changes in this tag; both apply just to CLM4.5:

   (1) Addition of 3-d snow history fields: These history fields (inactive by
       default) provide diagnostics for each layer of the snow pack. This
       involved adding some additional history file infrastructure to handle
       the variable number of snow pack layers. See the new section in the
       user's guide (custom.xml) for a description of how these new history
       fields work, and how to interpret them.

   (2) Change the harvest logic for transient runs that extend past the end of
       the pftdyn dataset: Until now, harvest was set to 0 when you passed the
       end of the pftdyn dataset. With this tag, this behavior is changed, so
       that for all years past the end of the pftdyn dataset, harvest rates
       remain fixed at the last year's value.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_60

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 transient runs that continue past the end of the pftdyn dataset
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      New climate: Harvest rates are now continued past the end of the pftdyn
      dataset (staying fixed at their value from the last year), for the
      remainder of the simulation. This leads to potentially large answer
      changes for transient runs that continue past the end of the pftdyn
      dataset.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: use new get_curr_yearfrac function in clm_time_manager

Purpose of changes:

   Use the new get_curr_yearfrac function in clm_time_manager in place of
   dyn_time_weights. The reason is that, as Erik pointed out, dyn_time_weights
   was out of place in dynUtilsMod, and really this functionality belongs in the
   clm_time_manager module.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_58

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45, either transient or with DV
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

     Ran testing on an intermediate tag, where I computed the time weights in
     both the old and new ways. I confirmed that the difference in time weights
     (which is the only change in this tag) is always less than 1e-13. Actually,
     this difference is always less than 2e-16, double-precision roundoff.

     Also examined cpl hist diffs for a few select tests. Diffs are generally
     ~ 1e-6 after 5 days.

========= Make a new directory to hold all of the stuff related to dynamic
          subgrid weights. Currently this means transient PFTs, but soon it will
          also mean dynamic landunits. This includes stuff that used to be in
          pftdynMod and dynlandMod, as well as a bit from clm_driver. I have
          added a new driver for the dyn_subgrid stuff (dynSubgridDriverMod),
          and pulled out much of the shared, lower-level functionality into new
          modules (dynTimeInfoMod, dynFileMod, dynVarMod, dynVarTimeInterpMod,
          dynVarTimeUninterpMod, dynUtilsMod [which will soon go away]). In
          addition, I have separated the many routines in pftdynMod into
          separate modules, each with a single, better-defined function.

  but extends beyond it, without an intervening restart (see bug 1899)

  (2) Could theoretically change answers for yellowstone-pgi or hopper-pgi due
  to machines updates, but no changes showed up in the yellowstone test suite

One-line Summary: change CNDV water conservation to use the pftdyn method

Purpose of changes:

   For my dynamic landunit work, I was trying to reconcile what's going on with
   prescribed transient PFTs (pftdyn) vs CNDV. The reason is that I'm trying to
   set up an overall control flow for dynamic landunits, and you need to be able
   to run either of these in conjunction with dynamic landunits.

   In doing this, I noticed that water conservation is handled differently for
   pftdyn vs CNDV:

   For pftdyn, water conservation is done as described in section 21.2 of the
   CLM4.5 tech note: water contents are summed before and after transition, and
   the difference is put in the runoff term

   CNDV appears not to use this before & after difference. Instead, it does a
   correction for canopy water in pftdynMod: pftdyn_wbal.

   For dynamic landunits, we're planning to use an approach like what is
   currently done for pftdyn. I think it's going to be messy and confusing to
   try to maintain the current CNDV approach when it's possible to have CNDV in
   conjunction with dynamic landunits.

   Thus, I am changing CNDV to use the pftdyn approach to water conservation,
   whether or not you are running with dynamic landunits. This will change
   answers for CNDV/BGCDV cases in CLM4.5, though I expect the effects to be
   small.

CLM testing:

  NOTE: Most testing was done from tag cndv_water_conservation_n01_clm4_5_55 -
  up-to-date with clm4_5_55, NOT clm4_5_56. I then updated to clm4_5_56 and
  reran just the three tests that were run for that tag (see its ChangeLog
  entry, below), with comparison to clm4_5_56.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 with DV (CNDV / BGCDV)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      
      Not investigated, but expected to be larger than roundoff/same climate

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: add hooks to Sean Santos's unit test framework, and begin to add CLM unit tests

Purpose of changes:

   (1) add hooks to Sean Santos's unit test framework

   (2) begin to add CLM unit tests

   Note: this tag currently does NOT have the CMake utilities that are needed to
   run the unit tests. Instead, the instructions show how to point to a version
   of these in my directory. That's because, as of the time I submitted this tag
   for testing, the necessary working version of the CMake utilities was not yet
   tagged. In the near future, another external could be added to pull in these
   CMake utilities in the CLM directory tree.

One-line Summary: refactor restart interfaces

Purpose of changes: Refactor restart interfaces.  Most work done by mvertens.

1) Add two *.F90.in files that use genf90.pl go generate source.  This saves time
   in dev. and maintenence.  If you modify only the *.F90 file, your changes will
   be lost.  Instead modify the *F90.in file, then run genf90.pl on that file.  
   If you have questions, ask a clm developer for help.
2) Restart capability has now been encapsulated in a subroutine call that uses
   Fortran 2003 interfaces over type and dimension.  For example:

-    if (flag == 'define') then
-       call ncd_defvar(ncid=ncid, varname='grainc_storage_to_xfer', xtype=ncd_double,  &
-            dim1name='pft',long_name='grain C shift storage to transfer',units='gC/m2/s')
-    else if (flag == 'read' .or. flag == 'write') then
-       call ncd_io(varname='grainc_storage_to_xfer', data=pcf%grainc_storage_to_xfer, &
-            dim1name=namep, ncid=ncid, flag=flag, readvar=readvar) 
-       if (flag=='read' .and. .not. readvar) then
-           if (is_restart()) call endrun
-       end if       
-    end if
+    call restartvar(ncid=ncid, flag=flag,  varname='grainc_storage_to_xfer', xtype=ncd_double,  &
+         dim1name='pft', &
+         long_name='grain C shift storage to transfer', units='gC/m2/s', &

One-line Summary: rework downscaling of atm fields for glc_mec

Purpose of changes:

A number of changes related to downscaling atm -> clm fields for glc_mec
landunits:

(1) Add new options to downscale precip (division into rain/snow) and longwave
    radiation (developed by Bill Lipscomb). Both are currently off by default.

(2) Move downscaling code out of clm_driverInit into clm_atmlnd.F90 - this is a
    more appropriate module, and is a step towards modularity, because the code
    to deal with the atmospheric forcing fields lives in the same module as the
    definition of these atmospheric forcing fields.

(3) Ensure that all code uses the downscaled, column-level fields where
    possible. Previously, some code (which did not operate over glc_mec
    landunits) used the non-downscaled, gridcell-level version of fields such as
    forc_t. This was a problem because (a) it was confusing and error-prone, and
    (b) we will soon be bringing in code to do downscaling over other landunits
    as well as glc_mec landunits.

(4) To support (3), and make it harder for someone to accidentally use the
    gridcell-level version of a field when they should be using the downscaled,
    column-level version: Broke clm_a2l into two pieces - one containing fields
    that aren't downscaled, and one containing fields that are downscaled. For
    fields that are downscaled, clearly distinguished the non-downscaled
    versions so they couldn't be used by accident.

========= Significant changes: includes stuff that used to be in
          clm_driverInitMod; added new downscaling code for precip & lwrad;
          split atm2lnd type into two types; reworked initialization interfaces;
          removed unused field rainf, because it currently isn't used and could
          theoretically become inconsistent with the downscaled rain/snow
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/clm_atmlnd.F90

========= Removed downscaling code from here
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/biogeophys/clm_driverInitMod.F90

========= Added call to downscale_forcings
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/clm_driver.F90

========= Changed interface to init_atm2lnd: previously, clm_initialize used
          clm_a2l from clm_atmlnd and passed it to init_atm2lnd_type (also in
          clm_atmlnd) - there was no reason for this, it was confusing, and to
          some extent broke modularity

    Note the following expected nlcomp failures:

One-line Summary: Swenson anomaly forcing - Part 1

purpose of changes:
   add additional data streams to modify existing
   data streams for purposes such as bias correction or specifying 
   future changes relative to baseline data streams, e.g. specifying
   future atmospheric forcing anomalies when running CLM with data atmosphere. 
   Paired with datm8_131115.

   For what to set in user_nl_cpl, user_nl_datm, see testing section.

   This is part 1 of 2.  Part 2 will address a general way to handle
   streams in the DATM that is triggered off of an AF compset.

One-line Summary: remove zeroing out of slope for special landunits

Purpose of changes:

   Previously, there was code to zero out slope for grid cells with 100% special
   landunits. However, there were a number of problems with this:

   (1) With dynamic landunits, this is problematic, because a grid cell could
   start as 100% special landunits, then later become < 100% special landunits
   (e.g., due to retreating glaciers)

   (2) Moreover, why should the slope of a special landunit depend on whether
   the grid cell has 100% special landunits. This seems to be saying that, e.g.,
   the slope of a glacier landunit depends on whether the grid cell is entirely
   glacier or part glacier and part natural veg.

   (3) And I guess moreover, why is the slope zeroed out for special landunits
   in the first place?


   From talking with Erik, we decided thish code was probably a relic from a
   time when the surface dataset had some bad values (e.g., over Greenland /
   Antarctica). This is no longer the case, so this code is no longer needed.

    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      Not investigated carefully, but expected to be larger than roundoff/same
      climate - since this only affects a very small number of grid cells, and
      (I believe) only the urban pervious road in those grid cells

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse

One-line Summary: refactor daylength calculation, and other minor changes

Purpose of changes:

   (1) Compute daylength in a single place, and compute necessary variables at
   initialization rather than having them on the restart file

   (2) Compute daylength-related variables at initialization rather than having
   them on the restart file, both to clean things up and to fix some daylength
   bugs at initialization (these bugs were fixed in a kludgey way in clm4_5_44,
   and now are fixed robustly)

   (3) Fix daylength calculation at the poles (previously blew up due to
   roundoff errors) (doesn't change behavior currently, but could change
   behavior / answers if there were a vegetated landunit at the pole)

   (4) Fix sminn on restart, so that crop restarts can be bfb (bug 1846)

   (5) Add all_active namelist variable that makes even 0-weight points active,
   for testing purposes

One-line Summary: temporary hack to daylength initialization to provide baselines for the next tag

Purpose of changes:

   The next tag (clm4_5_45) involves a major refactor to the daylength
   calculation. That refactor is bfb in most respects, but gives differences in
   the first time step in a few situations.

   This tag (clm4_5_44) does the minimal changes needed to get the same results
   as clm4_5_45, in order to have more confidence when testing clm4_5_45. 

   Note that the changes here are a kludge that will be reverted in clm4_5_45.

    There were a number of expected compare_hist failures, as described below.

    There was one unexpected compare_hist failure:

    Diffs are just in voc cpl fields. CLM hist files are identical at the end of
    the run. An SMS version of this test passes. Interestingly, the kludgey code
    that I have added for clm4_5_44 isn't even executed in this test... so the
    only diffs should be in variable declarations and 'use' statements. And
    clm4_5_45 (which I will tag soon) gives identical cpl hist files to
    clm4_5_43. So there may just be a compiler fluke in the compilation of this
    tag with openmp enabled. Because clm4_5_45 will give identical results to
    clm4_5_43, I'm not worrying about this.

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 with BGC (and probably CN), involving
      either (a) initial conditions interpolated from a different resolution, or
      (b) a change in start date relative to the ref date of an initial file
      (which shows up in ERI tests) - see bug 1850
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
        Not investigated carefully, but almost certainly larger than
        roundoff/same climate, since this code mod just changes things in the
        first timestep.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: allocate memory for most landunits in every grid cell (needed for dynamic landunits)

Purpose of changes:

   Main change is to allocate memory for most landunits in every grid cell, to
   support dynamic landunits. Note that we ALWAYS do this extra memory
   allocation, so that the user isn't required to do interpinic between a
   non-dynamic run and a dynamic landunit run. (If we eventually change the
   restart file format / processing so that you can add / remove 0-weight points
   at will, then we could potentially add some logic to only do this extra
   allocation if we're using dynamic landunits.)

   Supporting changes are (1) determining which grid cells have enough parameter
   data to support urban landunits, (2) new initial conditions files, (3) in
   mksurfdata_map, don't set soil parameters to 0 under glacier, and set urban
   parameters even if urban cover is 0%

   Other changes are:

   (1) only do snow balance check over active columns

   (2) fix interpinic bug (bug 1839)

   (3) newer files for testing interpinic


   NOTE: All CLM4.5 initial conditions will need to be interpinic'ed to be
   usable in this tag (this has been done for all out-of-the-box initial
   conditions)

Requirements for tag:

Test level of tag: regular

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

   - 1839 (interpinic uses wrong column when there are 0-weight columns in the
     input file)

   - 1840 (snow balance check is executed over inactive columns)

   - 1825 (surface datasets need urban parameters even when pcturb is 0
     everywhere): partial fix - still waiting on new USUMB dataset

Known Limitations:
                                 1147 (mkgriddata can't straddle over Greenwich)

Describe any changes made to the namelist: new initial conditions for CLM4.5

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: new initial
conditions for CLM4.5

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

   Significant memory increases for all CLM4.5 configurations - memory is now
   allocated for all natural veg landunits, all crop landunits (if using
   create_crop_landunit), and most urban landunits.

   Also, significant performance decrease (~ 10%) associated with the above
   change, which I believe is mainly due to decreased cache friendliness.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_42

Changes answers relative to baseline: NO - but see note below:

   NOTE: This tag has the potential to change answers for cases using initial
   conditions that were interpinic'ed using the out-of-the-box interpinic,
   because of bugs in interpinic. This applies to CLM4.5 cases @ ne30 and hcru
   resolutions, as well as CLM4.5 cases using DV @ f09. However, no diffs showed
   up in the test suite, so it's possible that this isn't a problem.

One-line Summary: fix bug 1857 for CLM4.5 - CNDV running temperature means are incorrect

Purpose of changes:

   Fix bug 1857 for CLM4.5 (not yet fixed for CLM4.0!). From the bugzilla entry:

   In this code in CNDVMod:

       do p = bounds%begp, bounds%endp
          g = pft%gridcell(p)
          if (kyr == 2) then ! slevis: add ".and. start_type==arb_ic" here?
             tmomin20(g) = t_mo_min(p) ! NO, b/c want to be able to start dgvm
             agdd20(g) = agdd(p)       ! w/ clmi file from non-dgvm simulation
          end if
          tmomin20(g) = (19._r8 * tmomin20(g) + t_mo_min(p)) / 20._r8
          agdd20(g)   = (19._r8 * agdd20(g)   + agdd(p)    ) / 20._r8
       end do

   Notice that this is a loop over p, but it's updating gridcell-level variables.
   This means that the running temperature means aren't at all what they purport
   to be. e.g., in a grid cell with the 17 natural PFTs and nothing else, the grid
   cell-level values will get the 17 pft values averaged in each year, rather than
   getting a single pft value per year. This means that these temperature
   variables are closer to a single year's value than to a running mean.

   The fix here should be simple: just change tmomin20 & agdd20 to pft-level
   variables.

   
   WARNING: USE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS TAG WITH AN OLDER RESTART FILE FROM A
   CLM4.5 DV CASE (this is not a problem for any out-of-the-box initial
   conditions files, but could apply if you have your own initial file from a DV
   run): In this case, the two DV-related variables AGDD20 and TMOMIN20 will be
   reset to their arbitrary initial conditions.

One-line Summary: fix Bug 1752 - urban conductances depend on weights in an undesirable way

Purpose of changes: 

Three parts to this tag.  Description from Oleson:

1) 
 fix Bug 1752 - modified UrbanMod.F90 to calculate
2) 
 add 2 new diagnostic history fields (FIRE_U, FIRE_R)
 the conductances correctly.  I created new variables to more clearly
 distinguish between scaled and unscaled conductances.
3)
 fix small bug in which the history field output of some of the
 anthropogenic heat flux variables are not bfb on restart when finidat is blank.
 I found this when verifying bfb for the original bug fix.  The cause of this
 is initialization which sets non-urban to special value, instead of zero, which
 is what is desired. On restart, this initialization is not done and the history
 file set_nourb=0 has precedent.  A related issue is that eflx_building_heat is
 not zero for pervious/impervious road when nlevurb /= nlevgrnd.

One-line Summary: Get PTCLM working, fix a few small bugs

Purpose of changes:

Get PTCLM fully working. Allow PTCLM to work with ALL I compsets including clm4_0 compsets.
Add a new option to PTCLM from Keith Oleson --cycle_forcing to set it up to cycle over the forcing.
Another option is to build datasets in the "-mydatafiles" directory (by default under PTCLM
directory). The datasets now have creation time-stamps in them as well. Rename QIAN_tower_yrs
to -use_tower_yrs and remove QIANforcing (now chosen by compset).
scripts now has four different I1PT compsets two new ones for CLM40CN and CLM45BGC. datm
CLM_USRDAT domain file for CLM1PT forcing points to the ATM_DOMAIN_FILE/PATH. Add some new
datasets to the siteDIR from Keith Oleson. Update documenation, remove unused template dir.
Add a script to rename creation dates for map files, so you don't have to regenerate them
each day.

Fix a few small bugs. Allow clm4_5 to have suplnitro and bgc_spinup to only give a warning
rather than die. Fix a corrupted rawdata PFT file. Fix mkscripgrid.ncl for regional SCRIP
grid creation. Remove some leftover fine-mesh variables that aren't needed anymore. Remove
reference to scaled_harvest in CLM build-namelist which was removed a long time ago.

Remove a mapping file that didn't seem to be needed for clm4_0 mkmapdata (a default
didn't exist for it either). Add -usr_mapdir option to clm4_0 mksurfdata.pl which is needed
for PTCLM for clm4_0 compsets.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: CLM45 with CROP
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
       larger than roundoff, but not investigated in detail

       Note that no changes were observed in the test suite, but this is due to
       a limitation of the test suite (there are very few multi-year crop tests;
       the only global multi-year tests are the newly-passing PET tests, which
       don't have baselines)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

One-line Summary: fix threading in CLM4.5, and other misc fixes

Purpose of changes:
 
(Mostly) fix threading in CLM4.5. This consisted of:

(1) Rework initGridCellsMod to keep all points in a clump contiguous

(2) Add info in bounds derived type (not necessary, but this allows
for more error checking and simplifies some code)

(3) Fix which bounds are passed to reweightWrapup in initialization

(4) Get rid of syntax like foo(:) = 0, instead using explicit bounds

(5) Rework bounds declarations for subroutine array arguments, both in
caller (explicitly subset argument by bounds) and callee (use
assumed-shape array arguments rather than declaring upper bounds), and
add assertions on array sizes.

See https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/ccsm/Community+Land+Model+Developers+Guide
("Guidelines for passing array arguments to subroutines") for the new
conventions that are implemented here.

(6) Fix crop threading bug, related to nyrs (bug 1598), both in clm4.5 and clm4.0

However, note that there is still a crop threading bug (bug 1820), which will
need to be fixed in a separate tag.


Also, some unrelated changes:

(1) Fix size of a megan variable, both in clm4.5 and clm4.0.

(2) Remove some unused variables from Hydrology2Mod / SoilHydrologyMod

(3) Fix some bugs in histFileMod / histFldsMod

(4) Reorder a loop in SurfaceAlbedo to get better performance (especially with
expanded memory allocation for dynamic landunits, in an upcoming tag)

   Timing is currently 5-10% worse, due to calls to shr_log_errMsg, within
   shr_assert calls. This should return to previous timings in non-debug runs
   once shr_assert calls are ifdef'ed out in non-debug runs (this requires a
   csm_share update that Sean Santos is working on).

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_27

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All CLM45 cases
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: larger than roundoff/same climate

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   Sean Swenson performed two 20-year runs with and without the fix. His report
   is:

   There are some differences, mainly in runoff, and it looks like at the 1%
   level mostly, with a few scattered points showing up on the significance
   plots.  Other fields like latent heat, soil moisture/temperature, or water
   table show even less differences.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_27

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All crop cases (clm4.0 or clm4.5) that either
      use arbitrary initial conditions or use the clm4.5 out-of-the-box initial
      conditions for BGCCROP @ f19
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new
  climate): new climate


   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

     Sam Levis examined a 3-year run with arbitrary initial conditions, and
     verified that crop LAI is much more realistic in the new simulation
     (previously, crop LAI was near-zero for the first few years)

CLM testing:

- general note: for clm45 compsets-both clm and cpl history files change

- specfic testing for these bug fixes:

1) Water balance fix-ran a clone of run from Dave Lawrence:
   -- create_newcase -compset I1850CRUCLM45BGC -res f09_g16 -mach yellowstone -case /glade/u/home/dlawren/expts/clm4.5/clm45bgc_1deg4519_1850spin_bd

One-line Summary: Bring in Tony's changes to kick sno all the way up to the coupler layer, makes all 
                  CESM components more similar to each other

Purpose of changes:
   Bring in Tony's cplupa branch (cplupa_n06_clm4_5_24) to trunk. This branch moves sno
   fields all the way to the top coupler layer rather than being inside of CLM. This makes all
   CESM components more similar to each other.

   There was also some small fixes on the side that allow some more tests to work.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

        compsets using cism change answers for g2x gields

        many tests change answers with pgi, both on yellowstone &
        frankfurt, presumably due to new compiler

        nature of change not investigated


   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: refactor to allow CH4 params. to be read from netcdf file and clean up clm4_5_20

Purpose of changes: 
   The second of two tags that brings in parameters that are read from netcdf file (ch4 parameters).  Please 
   see the ChangeLog entry for clm4_5_20.

   - Bring in ch4 parameters
   - Combine fconsts file and fpftcon file.  New file name is paramfile (clm_params.c130821.nc)
   - Refactor so that types, subroutine names and type instances have the names params in them (instead of consts)
   - Remove many ch4 namelist vars. since they are now read from the param file
   - Add new namelist called use_aereoxid_prog to control old aereoxid namelist

   A bulk of this work was completed by Rajendra Paudel.

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone: OK.  Some changes to phys45 and phys45-crop.  Should be OK in next tag.

  regular tests (aux_clm): A few nlcomp differences that will go away in the next tag.  
     Other than a few expected failures due to new scripts entries, all OK.

    yellowstone_intel  OK        
    yellowstone_pgi    OK

One-line Summary: aux_clm testlist reorganization

Purpose of changes: 

    Reorganize all aux_clm tests and fix new failing tests.  As part of
    this, bring in a change from Maoyi for VIC w/vertical layers.
    A few bug fixes to get new tests working. 
    Why did we do this?

       1) better balance between frankfurt, yellowstone and various compilers
		 2) faster turn around time for development
       3) make sure current science functionality is properly tested
       4) removed outdated / irrelevant tests

    Other points:

       1) Introduce regular and short test list.  Testing now can consist of:

		    a) regular (must be run before handing off a tag to SEs and must be run
		       before committing a tag)
			 b) build_namelist (if namelists and/or build_system changed))
		    c) tools (only if tools are modified and no CLM source is modified)
			 d) short (for use during development and in rare cases where only a small
			       change with known behavior is added ... eg. a minor bug fix)
			 e) doc (no source testing required)

       2) PET tests will fail until threading is fixed in CLM

Requirements for tag: N/A

Test level of tag: regular.  ran tests with old testlists to double check any new mods.

Machines testing ran on:  (Tests in priority order)

  Note:

     1) All PET tests will fail until openMP is fixed.
     2) All IG compsets fail with the NAG compiler due to non-compliant f77 code.
     3) If one combination fails, it's backed up with a another combination that passes.
          There are one or two exceptions to this.

   I) aux_clm tests with old testlists:

    yellowstone/aux_clm     intel - OK  
    yellowstone/aux_clm     pgi   - OK

  CESM history file comparison: Not run since no baseline comparisons.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if applicable: CLM4_5_21 with old testlist.  Only ran generate with new testlists.

Changes answers relative to baseline: Only for VIC with vertical layers.

One-line Summary: ifdef and bounds refactor

Purpose of changes:  
- Almost all implementation by Mvertens
- Refactor ifdef use so that a majority are now in controlMod.F90.  This is the 
first step to removing them competely.
- Introduction of bounds_type and clump_type
- Refactor interfaces to support bounds_type and clump_type
- Bug fix from Sacks

Also: Changed layout of landunit, column and pft-level arrays: Previously, all
points for a given grid cell were grouped together. Now, all points for a given
landunit type are grouped together. This improves performance of loops over
filters, because it leads to more memory locality – this will be especially true
when we add more 0-weight points to arrays for the purpose of dynamic
landunits. For example, if a processor has 2 grid cells and there are 3 landunit
types:

Old layout in memory: (G1L1, G1L2, G1L3, G2L1, G2L2, G2L3)
New layout in memory: (G1L1, G2L1, G1L2, G2L2, G1L3, G2L3)

One-line Summary: refactor to allow CN and BGC params. to be read from netcdf file

Purpose of changes:

The first of two tags that allows all parameters to be read from a netcdf file to
provide sensitivity analysis capability, to increase modularity of code and to
remove "magic numbers" from code.  This tag introduces a new namelist variable
"fconsts" which points to a netcdf file of CN and BGC parameters.  In a future
tag, this netcdf file will be combined with CH4 parameters and PFT parameters.

Values are read in readConstantsMod.F90.  Each module that requires
a parameter provides a read subroutine.  That read subroutine is called 
from readConstantsMod.F90 and places parameters into a private type 
for that module.  For example, CNDecompMod.F90 provides readCNDecompConsts which 
is called from readConstantsMod and populates the type instance CNConstShareInst.
CHConstShareInst is then used in CNDecompMod as:

+ sminn_to_denit_decomp_cascade_vr(c,j,k) = -CNDecompConstInst%dnp * pmnf_decomp_cascade(c,j,k

which replaces:

- dnp = 0.01_r8
...
- sminn_to_denit_decomp_cascade_vr(c,j,k) = -dnp * pmnf_decomp_cascade(c,j,k)

A bulk of this work was completed by Rajendra Paudel.

One-line Summary: fix setting of bd in iniTimeConst

Purpose of changes:

In iniTimeConst, bd (bulk density) was being set incorrectly, so that,
for a given processor, the same value was being put in all (c,j)
locations. In addition to being incorrect, this meant that results
differed depending on processor count. This tag fixes this problem.

This only affects CLM4.5 BGC runs, because the bd array is only used
in CNNitrifDenitrifMod.F90. (However, as a side note: This array
SHOULD be used in DUSTMod and initSLakeMod, which currently recompute
bd.)

One-line Summary: rework urban indexing

Purpose of changes:

Change urban derived type and local variables in UrbanMod subroutines to go
lbl:ubl rather than 1:num_urbanl. There are a few reasons for this: (1) this
works better when the urban filter can change (with dynamic landunits), (2) more
consistency with the rest of the CLM code, (3) no longer have to remember
whether a given variable should be indexed by fl or l. The downside is that it
leads to slightly greater memory use.

Along with doing this, I also changed a few loops in UrbanMod to be simpler
(which is allowed with the above change).

Also, no longer run over 0-weight urban columns - we don't have to do this any
more now that I have reworked some loops in UrbanMod.

   Increase in memory use by UrbanMod, which should lead to a small overall
   memory increase - though this doesn't show up in most memcomp tests, showing
   that the increase is pretty small.

One-line Summary: only run filters over 'active' points

Purpose of changes:

In preparation for dynamic landunits, we only want to run most filters over
'active' points. This required changing landunit and column-level filters to
only run over active points. In addition, I changed the nourbanp filter to only
run over active points (in contrast to other pft-level filters, this filter had
previously operated over non-active points, too).

In addition, this tag includes some related changes, most of which were required
to get the code to run correctly in light of the above changes. Some of these
changes - in particular, the changes to reweightMod, filterMod, and the use of
the new filter_inactive_and_active in some places - effectively undid that
general filter change for select landunits (urban) or subroutine calls.

========= Change main filters to just run over active points; add new filters
          that include inactive as well as active points; refactor subroutines
          to avoid code duplication now that we have two groups of filters
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/filterMod.F90

========= Change filter to just run over active points
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/pft2colMod.F90

========= Change urban columns & pfts to be active whenever their landunit is
          active (to avoid making urban code messier)
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/reweightMod.F90

========= Get rid of wt > 0 checks, which are no longer appropriate in the code
          (checks of the active flags should be done instead - and these have
          been folded in to the filters)
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/biogeophys/UrbanMod.F90

========= Make a loop more consistent in its use of a filter; remove undesirable
          pactive check (because decomp_vertprofiles now sometimes operates on
          inactive as well as active points)
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/biogeochem/CNVerticalProfileMod.F90

========= Use filters that include inactive points in call to
          decomp_vertprofiles (this is needed because of the unusual placement
          of this routine in the driver sequence)
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/clm_driver.F90

========= Use filters that include inactive points in calls to SurfaceAlbedo and
          UrbanAlbedo. For SurfaceAlbedo, this is necessary to avoid floating
          point exceptions in transient cases; for UrbanAlbedo, this probably
          isn't necessary now, but likely will be needed when we have dynamic
          landunits, for the same reason that we need it for SurfaceAlbedo.
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/main/initSurfAlbMod.F90

========= Remove pactive check in setting up vegsol / novegsol filters - as far
          as I can tell, this check is now unnecessary, and it led to the odd
          result that novegsol included all inactive points (e.g., even inactive
          istsoil points). Also add some comments and remove some obsolete
          comments.
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/biogeophys/SurfaceAlbedoMod.F90

========= Remove pactive checks that are unnecessary now that the nourbanp
          definition has changed
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/biogeophys/SurfaceRadiationMod.F90

========= Only check errsoi_col on active columns (to prevent NaN-related
          problems in crop runs)
M       models/lnd/clm/src/clm4_5/biogeophys/BalanceCheckMod.F90

One-line Summary: complete associate refactor for pointers in clm4_5 source

Purpose of changes:  Refactor all clm4_5 source so that pointers assignements are
   placed in associate blocks at the start of a subroutine.  This allows us to 
   get rid of pointer declarations, makes the code easier to modify, makes the
   code more robust and sets us up for future interface refactorings.  The refactor is
   explained in more detail in models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/refactorTools/README.

-    real(r8), pointer :: fdry(:)           ! fraction of foliage that is green and dry [-] (new)
-    fdry => pps%fdry
+   associate(& 
+   fdry               => pps%fdry             & ! Output: [real(r8) (:)]  fraction of foliage that is green and dry [-] (new)
+   )
 ...
-  end subroutine FracWet
+    end associate 
+   end subroutine FracWet

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all clm 4.5 with hydrology
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): new climate

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)

	casename: ERS_D.f19_g16.ICLM45 - an 11-year base line simulation
	was created with the standard trunk version, then a comparison run
	was created with the version including hydrology re-ordering.  The
	comparisons were evaluated by looking at the relative differences
	for hydrologic variables as QDRAI, EFLX_LH_TOT, QRUNOFF.  Large
	relative differences were found for these variables in a few grid
	cells, but their absolute magnitudes in those grid cells were
	small.  Tests were also conducted with VIC hydrology on, the
	change in results were similar as that when VIC hydrology was off.

Tag name:  clm4_5_11
Originator(s):  sacks (Bill Sacks,UCAR/CGD,303-497-1762)
Date: Tue Jun 11 20:54:11 MDT 2013
One-line Summary: Change pct_pft and related surface dataset variables to be % of landunit

Purpose of changes:

Main purpose is to change pct_pft and related surface dataset variables to be %
of landunit rather than % of grid cell. This is needed to support transient PFTs
with dynamic landunits. This required substantial changes in both mksurfdata_map
and CLM. This also required generating all new surface datasets.

A very related change is the separation of PCT_PFT in the surface dataset into
PCT_NAT_PFT and PCT_CFT; in addition to these two variables, there are also new
PCT_NATVEG (% of natural veg landunit on the gridcell) and PCT_CROP (% of crop
landunit on the gridcell) variables. Note that the separation of PCT_PFT into
natural vs crop was only done on the surface dataset -- raw datasets to
mksurfdata_map have not been changed, nor have most of the CLM data structures.

In addition, this tag includes the following:

(1) Renumbered landunits to (a) add separate landunit numbers for each urban
landunit, (b) do away with the obsolete shallow lake, and (c) group together
similar landunits

(2) In any urban landunit, allocate space for ALL urban columns. Previously,
there were some urban landunits with only one of the two road types. This change
simplifies the code and only adds a relatively small number of columns in memory.

(3) Modified interpinic, partly to have compatibility with (1), partly to fix
urban bug (allowed by (1)), and partly to fix an unrelated bug

(4) All new initial conditions for CLM4.5, to have compatibility with (1) and (2)

(5) Check _OPENMP in initialization rather than driver

(6) Tighten error check in reweightMod: checkWeights. It seems like this error
check can be stricter with the new pct_pft formulation


Requirements for tag: Standard test + tools

Test level of tag: standard

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
     1621 (normalization issue in ne120np4 datasets and in CLM)
     1675 (need to relax error tolerance in reweightMod: weightsOkay) -- note
          that I have actually TIGHTENED the tolerance, but that seems to be
          okay now
     1702- PARTIAL FIX (clm4.5 interpinic doesn't work right for urban)

Known bugs (include bugzilla ID):
    http://bugs.cgd.ucar.edu/

    1747 - need 1x1_tropicAtl surface dataset and pftdyn dataset for clm4_5_11 and later

Known Limitations:
                                 1147 (mkgriddata can't straddle over Greenwich)
                                 1025 (SCM mode can NOT use a global finidat file)

Describe any changes made to build system: None

Describe any changes made to the namelist: Changes to fsurdat and finidat for
CLM4.5, as described below

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 

   For CLM4.5, all surface datasets and initial conditions files have been
   recreated. For surface datasets, changes result in only roundoff-level
   differences in the pct_* fields. For initial conditions, the new initial
   conditions are effectively the same as the old, but bugs in interpinic
   prevent them from being exactly the same.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: 

   Slight (probably < 1%) increase in memory for all CLM4.5 cases, due to
   allocation of ALL urban columns wherever there is an urban landunit

CLM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if applicable: clm4_5_10

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Changes in all CLM4.5 configurations. See below
      for details
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      Mostly roundoff, but some larger than roundoff -- see below for details.

      Changes are limited to CLM4.5. Where the below notes refer to "all
      configurations", this is really limited to CLM4.5 configurations.

      For all configurations, there are roundoff-level changes due to
      roundoff-level differences in subgrid weights. These changes can quickly
      grow to greater than roundoff (which I believe is due to nonlinear
      feedbacks with snow variables), but as described below, I have verified
      that the root cause of differences is this roundoff-level change.

      For cases that use initial conditions, where these initial conditions were
      previously interpinic'ed, there are greater-than-roundoff level changes
      due to various bugs and limitations of interpinic (for example, some
      fields, like tsai, are skipped). I took pains to ensure that, for cases
      using original (non-interpinic'ed) initial conditions in clm4_5_10 and
      prior, the new initial conditions are nearly identical to the old (but not
      entirely identical, due to bug 1702 - see comment 2); this applies to most
      f09 initial conditions. However, this was not practical for cases that
      used interpinic'ed files; this applies to f19, ne30 and hcru initial
      conditions, as well as f09 BGCDV initial conditions. So for this latter
      set of cases, there can be large differences from clm4_5_10, especially at
      the start of the simulation.

      There are also greater than roundoff-level changes for some glc_mec
      virtual columns, because we now use information on topo_glc_mec whenever
      we can.

      There are also greater than roundoff-level changes in subgrid weights in
      virtual (0-weight) glc_mec and crop landunits, now that we no longer use
      arbitrary subgrid weights there; I don't think this will affect anything
      important, though.

      Some tests that exhibited larger-than-usual changes from baseline, in cpl
      hist and/or clm hist files, were the following (ignoring changes that can
      be explained by the above notes):
      
      ERS_Lm3.f19_g16.IGRCP60CLM45CN.yellowstone_intel
      ERS_D.f19_g16.ICLM45GLCMEC.yellowstone_intel.clm-glcMEC
      ERS_D.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCNoVS.yellowstone_intel.clm-rootlit
      ERS_Ld3_D_P64x1.ne30_g16.ICLM45CN.yellowstone_intel.clm-default

      From these results, it seems that large changes may occur more often in
      glc_mec runs, even above and beyond the virtual column changes that are
      expected, as noted above.

      For the four above tests, I verified that differences were attributable to
      the roundoff-level changes in subgrid weights, using the procedure
      documented below.


   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

      In order to confirm that answers only differed by roundoff, I ran 7
      additional tests (these tests all had nl_dirs, but that was not central to
      these tests, so I'm not listing them here):

          SMS_Lm1.f19_g16.I_1850_CLM45_BGC
          SMS_Ly2.T31_g37.IG1850CLM45CN
          SMS_Ly5.T31_g37.I20TRCRUCLM45BGC
          SMS_Ly5.T31_g37.ICLM45BGCDV
          SMS_Ly5.T31_g37.I_2000_CLM45_BGC
          SMS_Ly5.f10_f10.ICLM45BGCDVCROP
          SMS_Ly5.f10_f10.I_2000_CLM45_BGC_CROP

      Each test was done as follows:

      (1) Created baselines from clm4_5_04

      (2) Ran tests from a branch (allocate_all_urban_cols), where all I changed
      from the baseline was (a) wherever we have an urban landunit, create ALL
      urban landunits, and (b) for f19, change finidat files to use a new,
      interpinic'ed file based on the original. Confirmed that this was bfb with
      (1) except for (a) 1-d history files (now have extra urban columns), and
      (b) any CLM4.5 test that uses initial conditions, since interpinic is
      currently broken for urban.

      Side-note: I actually confirmed bfb behavior for the full yellowstone
      aux_clm test suite, in addition to the above 7 tests

      This extra branch was necessary because I cannot compare 1-d history files
      directly between my main branch and the trunk, because of the extra urban
      columns present in the new code.


      (3) Ran these 7 tests from my main branch, off of clm4_5_04, comparing
      with (2). For this comparison, I only confirmed that the subgrid weights
      were the same within roundoff (up to about 1e-12 differences for the
      transient case; smaller for other cases). Note that greater than
      roundoff-level changes are seen in many other fields, presumably because
      small differences in subgrid pft weights can cause differences in how
      variables are averaged from pft to column. This, in turn, can lead to
      larger changes due to nonlinearities in the system (e.g., snow). The
      following steps were taken to confirm that other differences between my
      branch and the trunk were only due to these small differences in subgrid
      weights.

      That is, I am confirming that:
      (a) the only differences in the branch are subgrid weights
      (b) these subgrid weights only differ by roundoff


      (4) Reran (2), but with extra code to write out subgrid weights (including
      writing these weights at every time step for pftdyn) -- from branch
      allocate_all_urban_cols_writeWeights

      (5) Reran (3), but with extra code to read the subgrid weights written in
      (4). Confirmed that, with this one-off, my branch was bfb with (4).

         ICLM45SP     and ICLM45BGC          @ f09
         ICLM45BGCCROP @ f19 and ICLM45BGCDB @ f09
     and ICLM40CRUCN   @ f09

   AND new initial conditions for RTM for ALL R05 grids

   And turning drydep namelist off in the driver causes answers to appear to be different
   when comparing coupler history files.

One-line Summary: make 'shared' tools directory, and other minor tools fixes

Purpose of changes:

- Make separate 'shared' tools directory, move some tools from the clm4_5
  directory into there.

- Change interpinic so that htop and hbot are skipped

- Change Makefile.common files in tools to use ifort by default on yellowstone,
  so users can just type 'gmake' without needing to do 'gmake USER_FC=ifort'. 
  For simplicity, this has been implemented by defaulting to ifort for ALL Linux
  machines. 

- Fix minor mksurfdata.pl bugs (1669, 1681).

Requirements for tag:
- fix bug 1669, 1681*
- only tools testing needed

Test level of tag: tools only

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
- 1669: change needed for mksurfdata.pl for smallville (or crop PFT override anyway)
- Changes to get mksurfdata.pl working with urban single point datasets

Known bugs (include bugzilla ID):
    http://bugs.cgd.ucar.edu/

Known Limitations:
                                 1147 (mkgriddata can't straddle over Greenwich)
                                 1025 (SCM mode can NOT use a global finidat file)
                                 1017 (SCM mode can NOT restart)

One-line Summary: Official end to CLM4.5 development for CLM offline

Purpose of changes: Changes from clm4_0_54 to now...

Compsets and Scripts Changes:

Remove ability to set compset file on command line, and use a new expanded compset file definition that
allows user to create many compsets on the fly by defining a long name with the "-user_compset" option
to "create_newcase". "-user_compset" is in the form of...

TIME_DATM[%phys]_CLM[40|45][%phys]_SICE_SOCN_RTM[%phys]_GLC[%phys]_SWAV[_BGC%phys]

Where
   TIME = Time period (e.g. 2000, 20TR, RCP8...)
   GLC  = [CISM1, SGLC]
   BGC  = optional BGC scenario
The OPTIONAL %phys attributes specify submodes of the given system

So for example 

./create_newcase -user_compset 1850_DATM%CRU_CLM45%BGC_SICE_SOCN_RTM_SGLC_SWAV -case cru1850 -res f19_g16 -mach yellowstone -compiler intel

will setup a 1850 case at f19 resolution with CRUNCEP forcing with CLM4.5-BGC.

Changes for both clm4.0 and clm4.5:

* Bug fixes in MEGAN VOC emission fluxes and dry deposition velocities
* CRUNCEP is now an option for atmospheric forcing
* Change from Sam Levis for CROP to pft-physiology file so that CROP parameter is in Kelvin rather than Celsius.
* Don't re-weight pftdyn if weights are essentially identical.

CLM4.5 includes the following:

* Bring in flood capability to RTM.
* Bring LBNL-merge branch on with: vertical soil, Methane, CENTURY, split nitrification, new-lake model.
* Modifications to GPP, on gppdev branch, multilayer canopy and then single-layer version that reproduces it.
* Crop model updates. Irrigation included with crop model as an option. Fix CNDV-CROP.
* Urban model updates, multi-density, urban depth seperate from soil depth, wasteheat to zero.
* Bring in permafrostsims09 branch with Sean Swensons's flooding changes.
* Update pft-physiology file, change some CN defaults, change min flow slightly in RTM.
* Set ponding to zero, acclimation mods from Keith Oleson, a hydrology change from Sean Swenson.
* Add active flags, change subgrid weighting convention.
* Turn off subgrid topography snow parameterization for glc_mec landunits.
* Jinyun photosynthesis change impacting arid regions.
* Keith Oleson's photosynthesis change, changes canopy top: triose phosphate util. rate to be dependent on vcmax.
* VIC hydrology is an option.
* Update mksurfdata_map for CLM4.5 (also add support for glc_nec=36 although we have no datasets for this).
* Snow depth averaged over grid-cell (SNOWDP) on history file changed in favor of SNOW_DEPTH (averaged only over snow covered area).
* Spinup changes from Charlie Koven from build-time to run-time (spinup now option added to CLM_BLDNML_OPTS as "-spinup on|off").
* Bring the F. Li and S. Levis Fire model for CLMCN and CLMBGC based on Li et al. (2012a,b; 2013).
* BSW calculation changed affecting drought phenology and frozen temperature sensitivity (SP, CN, and BGC as well as DV)

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 
   All CLM4.5 datasets are new.
   For CLM4.0, new ne120, ne240, and 360x720cru surface datasets (ne120 ne120 finidat files)
   new pft-physiology file

New history fields:
  Dozens of new fields for clm4_5.
  Three new fields for clm4_0:
+ <field name='QICE_FORC' units='mm/s' long_name='qice forcing sent to GLC'
+ <field name='TSRF_FORC' units='K'    long_name='surface temperature sent to GLC'
+ <field name='TOPO_FORC' units='m'    long_name='topographic height sent to GLC'

List any svn externals directories updated (csm_share, mct, etc.):

   rtm         to rtm1_0_22
   cism        to cism1_130405      (same as in cesm1_2_beta06)
   csm_share   to share3_130226     (same as in cesm1_2_beta06)
   esmf_wrf    to esmf_wrf_timemgr_130213
   timing      to timing_130214     (same as in cesm1_2_beta06)
   MCT         to MCT_2.8.3
   pio         to pio_1_6_7         (older than in cesm1_2_alpha07b)
   cprnc       to cprnc_130411      (same as cesm1_2_beta07)
   mapping     to mapping_130403    (same as in cesm1_2_beta06)

CLM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if applicable: clm4_0_54 (in cesm1_1_1)

Changes answers relative to baseline:  Yes

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in:

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change CLM4.0 are similar climate, CLM4.5 is of course new climate

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
