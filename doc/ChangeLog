One-line Summary: Reduce duplication between caps

Purpose of changes
------------------

 Eliminate duplication of the "derived quantities for required fields"
 and corresponding error checking codes that repeat across the mct,
 nuopc, and lilac caps. This consolidates the code and reduces
 maintenance requirements.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #918

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: Yes (Similar climate)

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: Larger than roundoff/same climate


Detailed list of changes
------------------------

 Changes were implemented in three steps:

 1) Bit-for-bit: @billsacks simplified subroutine QSat by making three
 arguments optional (es, qsdT, esdT).

 2) Answer-changing: @slevisconsulting replaced local calculations of
 qsat in /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc with calls to
 CTSM's subroutine QSat. Subroutine QSat uses a higher-order polynomial
 approximation to estimate qsat, which explains the larger than
 round-off diffs. When moving the three identical local approximations
 to QSat as a temporary test instead of using the higher-order
 polynomial approximation, the diffs reduce to round-off.

 3) Bit-for-bit: @slevisconsulting consolidated repeating codes in
 /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc by placing in the new
 file /src/utils/lnd_import_export_utils.F90.

One-line Summary: Start the clm5_1 physics series, with some changes to the fire model from Fang Li

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fang Li's latest Fire version - includes allowing clm5.1 phys version. New physics option is added
called "clm5_1", with currently the new feature to use the latest fire changes. This has some
adjustments to the fire model and includes some changes to the parameter file. Other new features
will be added into clm5_1 in future tags.

Also bring in mksurfdata changes for the raw urban dataset change. This adds some changes to
mksurfdata for a new urban raw dataset, as well as preparation for new changes for some other
urban changes that will be a future part of clm5_1. Also use the half degree lightning dataset
by default for clm5_1.

Start adding a new test list ctsm_sci that tests all the scientifically supported compsets.
Some of those tests fail due to existing issues, that will be fixed later.

Some more work done to change clm to ctsm, and allow for ctsm as a component.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): 
  Fix #1142 -- Add ctsm_sci test list
  Fix #1145 -- File was corrupted on glade
  Fix #1144 -- Move btran2 to just inside of fire model
  Fix #889 --- Some adjustments to the Li Fire model

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): None

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): Adds clm5_1 option to CLM_PHYSICS_VERSION
  clm5_1_GSWP3v1 is the only LND_TUNING_MDOE option for clm5_1
  New compsets added for CLM51 I2000Clm51BgcCropGs, I2000Clm51BgcGs, I1850Clm51BgcGs, IHistClm51BgcGs, IHistClm51BgcCropGs
     

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): clm5_1 physics options added in
    Add the ability to set the component name in filenames (default is still clm2, but can be clm4, olr clm5)
     By default lightning dataset for clm5_1 is the half degree file

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): All params files updated with new fields for fire

Substantial timing or memory changes: None
