One-line Summary: Small answer changes: urban ventilation, fire-emission, irrigate off when not crop, fix two SSP ndep files

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

The effects of ventilation (exchange of building air with canopy air) are accounted for in the energy budget inside the building.
The effects on urban canopy air are not. This remedies that.

This fixes an issue with how coefficients are applied to individual fire components.

SSP370 ndep file update.  Fix SSP245 ndep file.  Turn irrigation off for crop off

One-line Summary: Introduce vert. resolved MIMICS as new method to solve below ground decomp.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 Introducing new option to solve below ground decomposition: MIMICSWieder2015.
 The old option (CENTURYKoven2013) remains available. User will select one or
 the other via the namelist variable soil_decomp_method.

 Elin's MIMICS+ github issue relates: #1260.
 MIMICS spinup issues relate and are listed in caveats for users.

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
 #1473 : decomp_depth_efolding appears (with the same value) in the namelist
         and the params files; the model ends up using the one from the namelist


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
 MIMICS spinup method is in development
 Issues related to spinup
 #1451 -- MIMICS spinup
 #1455 -- Additional history output for Newton-Krylov spinup
 #1457 -- Adding history variables for Newton-Krylov spinup

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
 New option MIMICSWieder2015 for use with namelist variable soil_decomp_method
 decomp_depth_efolding removed as values on param files was already being used

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 CLM parameter files now include new MIMICS-related parameters prefixed with
 mimics_. Existing CENTURYKoven-specific parameters were renamed to include the
 prefix bgc_. Parameters used by both CENTURYKoven2013 and MIMICSWieder2015 have
 neither prefix.

Substantial timing or memory changes:
 Timing comparison between CENTURYKoven (BGC for short) and MIMICSWieder:
 In a 1x1_brazil test writing annual output and restarts every 10 yrs,
 BGC took ~2.8 hrs/100 yrs, MIMICS took ~3.6 hrs/100 yrs.

One-line Summary: Some fixes for Gregorian calendar

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

A few bug fixes for running with a Gregorian calendar. These primarily
fix the AnnualFluxDribbler, preventing balance errors in transient runs
(or in runs starting from restart files that came from transient runs).
But these general fixes end up fixing a few other minor issues with
Gregorian calendar runs as well.

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1590 (Gridcell water balance errors for some
  PLUMBER2 sites with branch_tags/PPE.n11_ctsm5.1.dev030)

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include issue #):
Other bugs with Gregorian calendar runs found in the course of making these fixes are:
- https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1595 (Bugs in crop phenology
  when running with a Gregorian calendar)
- https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1612 (Some uses of
  get_days_per_year should use the average number of days in a year, not
  the number of days in the current year)


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a multi-year test with Gregorian calendar
  (SMS_Ly5_Mmpi-serial.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHistClm50BgcCropQianRs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-gregorian_cropMonthOutput);
  as expected, this test fails on master but passes on this branch

Testing summary:

  regular tests (aux_clm: https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/System-Testing-Guide#pre-merge-system-testing):

    cheyenne ---- ok
    izumi ------- ok

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, but very limited

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Some runs with a Gregorian calendar
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      Larger than roundoff, same climate -- only very small changes

   The only test with answer changes is
   SMS_C2_D_Lh12.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Sp.cheyenne_intel.clm-pauseResume;
   that test just has answer changes in the time-0 history file because
   of the fix to the AnnualFluxDribbler's flux in the last time step of
   the year (which is the time step used for time 0). There were answer
   changes in only 6 fields, which are the fields impacted by changes in
   the land use change correction fluxes dribbled to the atmosphere and
   river:
   - EFLX_DYNBAL
   - FSH_TO_COUPLER
   - QFLX_ICE_DYNBAL
   - QFLX_LIQ_DYNBAL
   - QRUNOFF_ICE_TO_COUPLER

One-line Summary: mksurfdat toolchain part 1: gen_mksurf_namelist

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 This tag introduces ./gen_mksurf_namelist python script, which generates
 a user-modifiable control file (namelist) for use with #1430 (mkmap_data.py)
 within the context of #644 (wrapper tool for generating fsurdat files).

 The new namelist (control file) format does not have mapping
 files listed since the mapping file information are stored as part of the
 metadata for input data.

One-line Summary: Small changes to enable new fates dimension and update fates tag

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag uncomments the fates_levleaf dimension which was added in PR #1540
and rolled into PR #1542, but commented out to avoid junk DIFFs during integration
of PR #1542.  This variable is necessary to accomodate FATES PR #752, which
allows for an exponential spacing to bin widths in the VAI (LAI+SAI) calculations.
This latest fates tag also includes a fix to the fates satellite phenology mode
exact restart issue.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - CBALANCE_ERROR_FATES and FATES_ERRH2O_SCPF have round-off level errors that
      eventually propagate to downstream calculations for some some fates test mods
    - Differences are due to changing of the bin widths

One-line Summary: Implement dynamic (transient) urban capability

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This implements the capability to run transient simulations with changes
in urban density types. However, see Caveats for users section below.
If transient urban is activated (do_transient_urban=.true.) and an
appropriate landuse dataset is provided, the model will read in 
yearly PCT_URBAN for three density types from the landuse dataset and
adjust other landunits accordingly.
Water and energy are conserved for these transitions. Urban landunits
do not account for carbon and nitrogen, however, see the dynamic urban
design document (doc/design/dynamic_urban.rst) for a discussion of this.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
Note that this capability is off by default because landuse datasets
with transient urban on them are still being developed.
Note also that if this capability is activated (e.g., for testing) then
run_zero_weight_urban must be set to .true.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
Added do_transient_urban namelist variable

None.

One-line Summary: Adding fsurdat_modifier tool

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 I copied the next four paragraphs from /tools/modify_fsurdat/fsurdat_modifier:
 fsurdat_modifier is a tool that modifies fsurdat files. It reads a surface
 dataset (fsurdat file) and outputs a modified copy of the same file.

 Current applications are limited to the simplest CTSM(SP) mode, so bgc, fire,
 urban, vic, lake, transient, and crop-related variables in the fsurdat file
 remain unchanged.

 It differs from modify_singlept_site_neon.py in that the latter specifically
 modifies soil properties of single-point surface datasets. Some functions
 could/should become shared for use by fsurdat_modifier.

 It also differs from the subset_data tool in that the latter subsets fsurdat
 files to regional or single-point domains. Though subset_data includes some
 "modify" functionality when subsetting to single-point, we intend for similar
 functionality to be more extensive and more object oriented in
 fsurdat_modifier. Again, some functions could/should become shared among
 these tools.

One-line Summary: NEON UI update, externals updates, small miscellanouse fixes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Redo options list to remove positional arguments that were difficult to input correctly.
Transient runs now use run_type startup and get finidat from s3 server unless --run-from-postad option is used (or finidat is not
available). Use mpi instead of mpi-serial, this mod was recommended for container use. Add a new script neon_finidat_upload which
allows authorized users to upload finidat files to the s3 server.

This includes the following changes to the script for updating the surface dataset at neon sites using available neon data (i.e.
modify_singlept_site_neon.py) to address ctsm/issues #1353, #1429, and neon/issue #44:

Update Organic calculation to use the following equation based on discussions in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1375/files#r669590971 :
ORGANIC = estimatedOC * bulkDensity / 0.58

Because estimatedOC is rounded to the nearest integer in neon data, it is sometimes bigger than carbonTot. Therefore, in cases where
estimatedOC > carbonTot, we use carbonTot instead of estimatedOC in the above equation.

Previously, we had missing data on neon files for some neon soil layers (see Modified NEON surface datasets have errors  #1429
(comment)). Therefore, it caused some missing values in the updated dataset. Here, we interpolate to fill in the missing data using
different interpolation techniques. Finally, we chose to use linear interpolation to fill in missing data.

This includes the scripts for modification of the surface dataset for neon sites to address #1429.
Specifically, the following has been addressed in this PR:

Update the calculation of ORGANIC to use the new field (CaCO3) from NEON data.
For this calculation if CaCO3 data is available, we first calculate inorganic carbon by:
inorganic carbon = (caco3 /100.0869)*12.0107
Next, we calculate organic carbon by subtracting inorganic carbon from the total carbon:
[organic carbon = carbon_tot - inorganic carbon]
If the CaCO3 is not available then the code uses carbonTot and estimatedOC by NEON.

Discussed here (Modified NEON surface datasets have errors  #1429 (comment))
For the Ag sites (KONA and STER), it changes the PCT_NATVEG, PCT_CROP, and PCT_NAT_PFT to avoid the error that we previously had in
spin-up: surfrd_veg_all ERROR: sum of wt_nat_patch not 1.00000000000000 at nl= 1 sum is: 0.000000000000000E+000

Discussed here (Modified NEON surface datasets have errors  #1429 (comment))
There was a typo previously in the NEON data for ABBY sites caused by mix of sample measurements. Please note that this was updated
by hand once data was downloaded from NEON site.

With recent versions of CIME, the LILAC build with a user-defined machine was broken for a couple of reasons. This fixes it.

Fix mksurfdata_map for 1x1_brazil. Get tools testing working again. Increase skip_steps by 1, which is needed for a change in CAM
where balance checks need to occur after the radiation update now rather than before. glob changed for bsd_glob in perl MkDepends
for mksurfdata_map.

One-line Summary: API change with FATES to enable running means inside fates, includes passing in of model timestep

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This set of changes synchronizes CTSM with API 20 of FATES.  API 20 of FATES requires a modification to timing boundary conditions so that FATES can maintain its own internal running means.  FATES also no-longer asks CTSM for the 24hour vegetation temperature, since this is a patch(pft) level variable, and FATES has more suitable averaging mechanisms.  These changes are synchronized with FATES Pull Request: https://github.com/NGEET/fates/pull/724, which subsequently created tag: https://github.com/NGEET/fates/releases/tag/sci.1.52.0_api.20.0.0

[x] clm_fates

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Developers should be aware that FATES does require information on the model timestep, which was not necessarily available in initialize1. Efforts were made to circumvent needing the model timetep at this phase of initialization, so impact on non-fates code was minimal.


Testing summary:
----------------
  regular tests (aux_clm: https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/System-Testing-Guide#pre-merge-system-testing):

    cheyenne ----  PASS (fates had expectedly different results compared to base) 
    izumi -------  PASS (fates had expectedly different results compared to base)

  fates tests: (give name of baseline if different from CTSM tagname, normally fates baselines are fates-<FATES TAG>-<CTSM TAG>)
    cheyenne ---- PASS (fates had expectedly different results compared to base) 
    izumi -------


   Additional tests:
	Multi-decadal simulations were also run to evaluate fates side sensitivity to slightly different averaging scheme. The differences were not so subtle, attributed mostly to fixing an initialization bug (the previous 24hour temperature had initialized at 0K) and a 1-hour phase change in the 24-hour start-stop cycle.


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:  all FATES active simulations have different results.

One-line Summary: Refactor static fire data input by moving variables into fire_base_type from cnveg_state_type

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag refactors the static fire data input methodology to enable a future anthropogenic fire suppression 
methodology to FATES as described NGEET/fates#673. This future method requires that FATES have access to 
GDP data that was previously defined in CNVegStateType.F90 as part of cnveg_state_type.  As such, the GDP
variable has been moved into fire_base_type in FireDataBaseType.F90 to provide the data to the extended 
fates_fire_base_type for eventual use in FATES.  Similarly, the surface dataset read subroutine has been
moved along with the peat and ag-fire variables, which utilize the same read subroutine and where also
originally part of the cnveg_state_type.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
    Fixes #1104 -- Move static fire data into Fire class

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
    The ncd_io calls for the gdp, peat, and ag-fire data has been moved from the 
    cnveg_state_type InitCold procedure into a new subroutine called surfdataread
    which is a new fire_base_type procedure.
    
    The function GetGDP has been introduced to get the pointer to the GDP data.  This has
    been implemented in clmfates_interfaceMod.F90, but the assignment of this pointer
    to a FATES-side bc_in variable has been commented out pending a future update to 
    define the necessary FATES GDP variable.
    
    A new namelist option has been added to the fates_spitfire_mode series.  This option
    is intended as a simple placeholder for a future FATES fire supression mode.  The 
    option is currently being included as a check in clmfates_interfaceMod.F90 to allow
    for the exercise of the GetGDP function.

Testing summary:

    cheyenne ---- N/A
    izumi ------- N/A

  any other testing (give details below):
    A simple fates branch was created to test the potential handoff of the GDP data to FATES, which successfully
    output the global gdp data.  The branch is located here: https://github.com/glemieux/fates/tree/fire-gdp-simpletest
    Note that this branch was not used in the standard regression tests above.

One-line Summary: Updates to facilitate FATES history variable overhaul

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag facilitates updates to FATES history variable names, units, other metadata,
and flushing behavior. Variables are now initially flushed to the CTSM ignore value,
then flushed to 0.0 on the FATES side.

Calls were added to flush_hvars and zero_site_hvars inside the
init_coldstart and restart subroutines in clmfates_interfaceMod.F90.
FATES history variables names were updated to the new names in the
user_nl_clm hist_fincl1 lists in the testmods directory.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):

All FATES output history variable units and names have changed so any post-processing
scripts or history variable namelists (e.g. hist_fincl1) will be affected.


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
Changes to tests or testing:

Updated the hist_fincl1 namelists in the user_nl_clm files in the FATES
testmods directory to reflect FATES history variable name changes.

Updated name of ERS_Ld30.f45_f45_mg37.I2000Clm50FatesCruRsGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-FatesColdDefReducedComplexSatPhen
in the ExpectedTestFails.xml list, and changed the phase to RUN, as it is now
failing in the run phase.

     - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): diagnostic only

  All FATES output history variables and/or units changed so we expect DIFF
  or FIELDLIST differences for all comparisons to baselines.

  I created a test at a single point to compare FATES variables
  (over a 5-year simulation) from master (sci.1.50.1_api.18.0.0) and this
  updated branch. This test confirms that the old variables can be matched
  to a new variable (except for a select few where we removed some
  variables due to duplication), and that when we did see changes in the
  output values, these changes were the expected factor differences based
  on the intended units change.

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Changes to tests or testing:

    Replaced the only f19 grid resolution testmod in the izumi fates list with an f45 test
    since the pes layout change for izumi from ctsm5.1.dev062 results in high resolution grids
    taking longer to run now.  Coverage for high resolution fates tests is provided via cheyenne
    test lists.

    For the same reasons as above, I transferred the only high res (f19) grid resolution testmod
    in the izumi aux_clm list to cheyenne to maintain coverage for this test.  The ctsm5.1.dev063
    aux_clm baseline on cheyenne has been updated to include this test.

One-line Summary: Changes needed to get aux history output with cmeps

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

These changes are needed to create auxiliary land history files when the
new cmeps configuration variable is set to true. histaux_l2x1yrg =
.true.

The changes needed in CTSM enable lnd2glc fields to be sent to the
mediator even if glc is not present - based on querying the
histaux_l2x1yrg setting.

This includes a related change to set most lnd -> mediator fields to
spval over ocean, instead of sending zero values over ocean.

      Just changes missing value patterns for lnd -> mediator fields

      Most lnd -> mediator fields now have missing value over ocean
      instead of sending zero values over ocean. This shows up as
      FILLDIFFs in most nuopc tests.

One-line Summary: Izumi aux_clm test fixes for fates testmods

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag corrects an accidental inclusion of non-debug, nag compiled fates testmods
into the izumi aux_clm test list.  It also makes corrections to the expected failures
list as well as adjusts the fates izumi test list as well as updates the externals
file to point to the most recent fates tag (which includes a science update so answers
change for FATES).

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Changes to tests or testing:

    Changed the non-debug fates testmods in the izumi aux_clm list to compile with intel
    instead of nag to avoid fates issue 771 and provide testing parity with the cheyenne
    aux_clm list.

    Removed two tests from the fates izumi test list:
      - FatesColdDefAllVars testmod as it takes too long to complete due to history writes
      - f19, 3-day, ERP fates testmod due to a sporadic memleak

One-line Summary: Update fates tests and list for diversity and coverage

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag changes the list of fates testmod represented in the aux_clm category test list
to provide an updated set of testmods to improve coverage and diversity of fates modes
to be checked during ctsm updates now that fates is updating directory to the ctsm main/master
branch.  A number of updates were made to the fates category list as well, including
test name changes, variables including for fates testmods, and the addition of a fates landuse
testmod.

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Changes to tests or testing:
    - The list of fates testmods that are included as part of the aux_clm testlist has been updated to
      change older compset coverage for newer Clm50 compsets.  It also changes the list of fates testmods
      to improve coverage for stable fates run mode options.
    - The list of tests for the fates test category on all machines has been updated to use river stub compsets
      for most tests in an effort to reduce test runtime.
    - The list of tests for the fates test category on izumi has been change to only include debug-only tests as
      a short term work around for FATES #771
    - The output variables for most all fates testmods is updated to only include site-level variables in an
      effort to decrease history write time for any given test
    - Updates the expected failure test list to remove out-of-date entries failures
    - Many of the fates testmods have been renamed to be have a more broadly consistent naming scheme that denotes
      which testmod is a baseline for a given testmod
    - FatesColdDefLandUse testmod has been added to gain coverage for the do_harvest mode

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Change ceta from 450 to 358 for CTSM5.1 See Leo VanKamenhout's work on this in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/250. Note, this is used in the PPE work.
See van Kampenhout et al. (2017).  Turn Medlyn on for PHS off for clm51 and clm50.
Make max CO2 partial pressure consistent in Photosynthesis.
Change surface datasets to only use 78PFT versions
Fix GSSUN and GSSHA history variables so now not just writing missing values.
Changes FATES to run with use_nitrif_dentrif=T by default. Change dynlakes test
to methane/use_nitrif_=T.

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):

   Fixes #1503 -- VIC cases can't use crop surface datasets because of missing vic data #1503

   Fixes #1496 -- SP NoAnthro case fails... #1496

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  stomatalcond_method is now Medlyn2011 for clm5_0 and clm5_1
  use_nitrif_denitrif is now TRUE when using FATES

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New parameter file for clm5_1 (changes ceta)

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  Surface datasets are now labeled with use_vichydro=TRUE in the xml. This also means that some files
  listed in the XML are listed twice for VIC both on and off (that's important for FATES since it still
  requires non-crop datasets (see #1505)

  Also the logic for finding both fsurdat and flanduse_timeseries files needs to be the same in first
  asking for a crop version and then an exact match if it isn't found (unless it's FATES and then you just
  do the exact match).

Changes to tests or testing:
  Dynamic lakes test now has methane on, which works because we turn off methane conservation check after restart
  See #43 for more information on this.

    - what code configurations: Most
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change:
        similar climate most changes are near roundoff level

    All clm5_1 physics change answers because of change in ceta parameter.
    When PHS off for clm5_1 and clm5_0 changes answers because of Medlyn photosynthesis over Ball-Berry.
    Photosynthesis potentially changes all the time because a maximum parameter was off.
    Answer should be close to roundoff for Sp and Bgc cases without Crop because we now use crop surface datasets.
    FATES changes answers since user_nitrif_dentrif is now on by default
    COLDSTART BGC cases will change answers because of a change in initial soil temperature
    clm4_5 and clm5_0 vichydro results are identical
    clm4_5 and clm5_0 single point urban tests are identical
    Some tests are still identical mostly crop-cases non-cold-start
    In some cases GSSUN and GSSHA will be different.

One-line Summary: FATES Satellite Phenology mode implemented

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This PR enables FATES TLAI, TSAI, and HTOP to be driven by the host land model
satellite data sets.  The parameter file has been updated to include an array
mapping the indices of the host land model pfts to fates pfts.  FATES satellite
phenology mode automatically enables two additional reduced complexity modes:
fixed biogeography and no competition.  The former had previously been
implimented although this update corrected an error associated with this mode.
The latter is a new mode introduced in this PR as well and a corresponding
regression test has been added along with a new sp mode regression test.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
  The SPITFIRE model is set to fail gracefully if accidentally enabled in conjunction with sp mode.
  There is a known error in the satellite phenology exact restart, so restarts should not be
  attempted until issue #1485 has been resolved.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
  History variables TLAI, TSAI, and HTOP are updated to reflect the fates sp mode outputs by means
  of overwriting the existing history outputs.  The original canopystate variables are still
  calculated, but not available to the user.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  Add namelist option: use_fates_sp, use_fates_nocomp

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New fates paramter file which include hlm to fates pft indexing map

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  All single site fates suite tests need to be manually built and submitted given MOSART #45.  PR #1275 will resolve
  this by switching to a non-MOSART compset.

One-line Summary: New parameters on paramsfile, many bit-for-bit changes, new history fields for IWUELN,VPD_2M, allow Medlyn Photosynthesis for non-PHS cases, fixes to HumanStressIndex

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Brings more hardcoded parameters to the paramsfile. Some bit-for-bit cleanup. A fix for HumanStressIndex. Adding IWUELN
and VPD_2M diagnostic to history output. Add in ability to run Medlyn photosynthesis for non-PHS cases (not turned on yet though).
Most of the addition of parameters is from Keith Oleson.

Daniel Kennedy added two new diagnostic fields available for history outuput.
IWUELN: the intrinsic water use efficiency at local noon (umolCO2/molH2O)
VPD_2M: vapor pressure deficit at 2m reference height (pascals)

The Medlyn stomatal conductance functionality was deployed for CLM5. It had not been implemented for use_hydrstress=.false
(i.e.  SMS).  Previously if we opted for: use_hydrstress=.false and stomatalcond_method = 'Medlyn2011',
the model would actually use the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model. Daniel Kennedy adds the changes to allow this for
non-PHS.

Human Stress index changes are from Jonathan Buzan and Keith Oleson.

Some clean-up work on arctic vegetation changes. Also removal of the option to run non-CENTRY based soil
decomposition model. CN options are removed along with use_century_decomp and use_vertsoilc. use_nitrif_dentrif and
use_lch4 are still retained, but recommended to be always on, and will be removed later.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
  Vertical soil carbon is now hardcoded to on. This means that if you had run a simulation
  with it turned off -- you won't be able to use it's restart files in this versions and after.
  Likewise with CENTURY-BGC.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
  Removed namelist options: wrtdia, use_vertsoilc, use_century_decomp, min_wind_snowcompact
  Added namelist options:   min_critical_dayl_method, soil_decomp_method
    New options for min_critical_dayl_method, DependsOnVeg and DependsOnLatAndVeg

  Remove 1x1_camdenNJ and 1x1_asphaltjungleNJ grid options
  Remove some uneeded grids and files, correct 360x720cru grid for mksurfdata_map
  Remove vestiges of ch4 files in mksurfdata_map
  Remove the "cn" option to "-bgc" in CLM_BLDNML_OPTS and remove Cn compsets and tests

  New history variables: VPD2M, IWUELN (FV made default active)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New parameter files

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   After we turn on methane and nitrfication-dentrification for all configurations we
   can remove the use_lch4 and use_nitrif_denitrif options

Changes to tests or testing:
    Removed CN and 1x1_camdenNJ tests as well as NoVSNoNI
    Shortened 1x1_cancouverCAN test as it ran beyond the end of data
    Changed name of "rootlit" test to "anoxia" as that was the only thing it does, it now
      also runs with vertical soil Carbon profile

One-line Summary: Wrapper script for running NEON sites, and some NEON updates

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This is a wrapper script for running CTSM simulation for one or more neon sites using
CIME case objects.

This script accomplishes the following:

Downloads and parses neon listing file for the available neon data :
https://neon-ncar.s3.data.neonscience.org/listing.csv

Create a base generic case and clone other cases from this generic base case.

Enable the user to run in AD, Post-AD, and transient mode.

Currently, there is no case dependency or case status check in the code. Which means
that the user cannot run Post-AD +AD + transient all at the same time. If we add case
dependency, then the code that checks the status of a case (e.g. spinup) every 2
seconds and once it is finished successfully submit the next phase (e.g. transient.)

Externals are also updated to fix some NEON issues.

New tools subdirectory site_and_regional and current scripts for handling single-point
moved underneath. Also README files and tools testing changed for this move. Also tools
test added for the new wrapper script talked about above. Fix an issue in subset_data.py
where it couldn't be run from outside of a git directory because it checks for the git hash.

Changes so that CTSM will write restarts as signaled at end of simulation by the CMEPS mediator.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, just roundoff-level for pgi

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: anything with LUNA
    - what platforms/compilers: pgi
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

     I verified that the answer changes just arise due to an extra
     multiplication by 1 in LUNA, which must change order of operations
     for pgi. (I compared with this one-off from master and was
     bit-for-bit:

One-line Summary: Update externals, NEON updates, fix stop_option=date, move neon niwo test to match user_mods, local time option

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Move the NEON_NIWO test to NEON/NIWO to match the names in usermods. Output particular fields for the NEON
cases, and use a reduced size dataset for lightning for NEON sites. Update NEON surface datasets with
new scripts included here. Fix stop option for NUOPC. NEON NIWO test in testlist explicity uses the user-mod
as well as the defaults testmod.

This script is for modifying the surface dataset at neon sites using data available from the neon server.

Also add the ability to output history fields for a particular time of day (in seconds) with the LXXXXX
history averaging option from Ronny Meier.

Externals are updated extensively to the version with cpl7 cime directories split out for CESM.

 I used existing infrastructure to add descriptive strings to certain history

 Some variable names for pools was also changed to use terms consistent with the new

One-line Summary: Start bounds at 1; remove references to MCT

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Users: take note of (1), and in particular the caveat for users noted
below (in the "Notes of particular relevance for users").

(1) All global index arrays on a given processor now have a starting index of 1
  - bounds_proc for each subgrid level has a starting index of 1 for each level
  - bounds_clump for each subgrid level has a starting index of 1 for just
    the first clump on the processor - but all the other clumps on the
    processor do not start at 1 - but rather are offset with the number of
    gridcells, columns, ...etc on the preceeding clumps

(2) There are no longer any references to any mct data structures other than in the mct cap
  - All references to gsmap have been removed from decompMod.F90 and
    replaced with new global index arrays for the various subgrid levels
  - decompInitMod has been refactored to calculated these global index
    arrays using pure MPI rather than mct
  - ncdio_pio_F90.in has been refactored to use the new global index
    arrays rather than the gsmap data structures
  - the data struture ldecomp is no longer needed
  - the module spmdGathScatMod.F90 is no longer needed and has been removed

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):

  done at a higher level, simplifying array argument passing)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Until now, if the model produced an error message with a gridcell or
  subgrid index (e.g., "Error at p = 1234"), you could rerun the model
  with write statements in conditionals like "if (p == 1234) then". With
  the changes in this tag, this simple conditional is no longer
  possible. Instead, you will need to also reference the processor
  number that produces the error.

  If the error message is produced in the lnd log file, then you can
  have a conditional like:
    if (masterproc .and. p == 1234) then

  If the error message is produced in the cesm log file, then you can
  have a conditional like:
    if (iam == X .and. p == 1234) then

  where X is the processor number that produced the message. On some
  machines (including cheyenne), this processor number is printed at the
  start of each line in the cesm log file. In addition, some aborts will
  now print "proc_id = X", and that value can be used.

  Soon we will update
  https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/users_guide/trouble-shooting/trouble-shooting.html
  to document the new recommended procedure.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

 The FATES parameter file now contains new fields. Users must update their personal parameter
 files to contain these new fields.  See src/fates/parameter_files/fates_params_default.cdl

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

   Developers should also be aware of the new fates parameter file format.

One-line Summary: Include CWD in heterotrophic respiration (HR)

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 Params file sets the respiration fractions for CWD to zero:
 rf_cwdl2_bgc = 0
 rf_cwdl3_bgc = 0
 The model has no code to handle rf_cwd* > 0. So...
 - I have introduced cwdhr_col to track this HR the same way that we track
 lithr_col for litter.
 - I have removed if-statements that prevented CWD HR pools and decomposition
 from writing to history.
 - I have introduced a new test to the cheyenne test-suite that makes active
 seven history fields pertaining to CWD HR and points to a params file with
 rf_cwd* > 0. I have confirmed that the new test returns the new active
 variables as greater than 0 when pointing to the new params file and equal
 to 0 when pointing to the default params file.

One-line Summary: New stream functionality when using NUOPC or LILAC

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This tag creates new stream functionality when using the NUOPC and LILAC
caps, and maintains backwards compatibility with the older CPL7 stream
functionality when using the MCT cap.

- New stream code has been placed in src/cpl/share_esmf (so that they
  can also be leveraged by LILAC)
- Older stream code for mct is now in src/cpl/mct
- LILAC interface has been changed to leverage the new stream code as well

Where possible share code was used. In particular, this holds for SatellitePhenologyMod.F90.

---------------------------------------

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New mesh stream entries are needed now for NUOPC and LILAC compsets

Substantial timing or memory changes: None for mct. For
ERS_Ly3_P72x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput,
overall run time is slightly less than the baseline - probably within
machine variability. A more careful investigation would be needed to
determine if the CDEPS streams have changed performance significantly
relative to the MCT-based streams, but the overall timing suggests that
there probably aren't *large* differences.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
 Moved initial_Cstocks_depth_bgc and initial_Cstocks_bgc from the
 namelist to the params file. Also renamed tau_cwd to tau_cwd_bgc and
 k_frag to k_frag_cn in the params file according to the models that use
 these parameters.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
 initial_Cstocks_depth_bgc and initial_Cstocks_bgc are not namelist
 variables anymore.

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 There are new params files for clm45, clm50, and ctsm51.

Substantial timing or memory changes:
 FAIL PFS_Ld20.f09_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel MEMCOMP Error: Memory usage increase > 10% from baseline
  Throughput doesn't seem to change. There might be an increase in memory as it's indicated for 20 tests.
  And some arrays were changed to add an extra dimension.

    cheyenne ---- OK (read above in "bugs introduced" about CN failures)
    izumi ------- OK (read below in "other testing" about pgi failures)

  any other testing (give details below):
 Two unexpected tests fail on izumi, so I performed additional testing.
 The tests that fail:
 1) SMS_D.f10_f10_mg37.I2000Clm51BgcCrop.izumi_pgi.clm-crop
 BASELINE ctsm5.1.dev042: DIFF roundoff
 2) SMS.f10_f10_mg37.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.izumi_pgi.clm-crop
 BASELINE ctsm5.1.dev042: DIFF greater than roundoff for CH4-related vars
 I confirmed same result with my earlier commit against BASELINE dev033.

 Same tests but with gnu/intel instead of pgi pass on izumi for both
 comparisons to dev042 and to dev033. These tests are part of the izumi
 test-suite already.

 Additional testing:
 Repeated these gnu/intel tests (had to run for baseline first) on cheyenne
 and they passed.

One-line Summary: Updates to coupling interface to enable FATES-CH4, and to be compatible with FATES-CNP.

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

These changes are only relegated to the API with FATES. Boundary conditions were prepared within
FATES to enable proper use of the methane model. Further, some minor changes were made to the FATES
interface code (clmfates_interfaceMod.F90) allowing compatibility with FATES tag sci.1.46.0_api.16.0.0
(https://github.com/NGEET/fates/releases/tag/sci.1.46.0_api.16.0.0). Most of these changes have to do
with how the FATES history interface is instantiated.

One-line Summary: Replace masked with "nomask" SRC files for use with mkmapdata and mksurfdata_map

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 1) Collapse multiple source (SRC) files of a given resolution to a
 single "nomask" SRC file per SRC resolution. The mask variable is now
 set to 1 everywhere in all SRC files and mkmapdata.sh generates
 a single map_ file (aka weight file) per destination (DST) resolution.
 2) The executable mksurfdata_map now applies the SRC mask found in the
 raw datasets, since the map_ files do not contain this information.

 These changes simplify the introduction of new surface variables with
 raw data in one of our existing SRC resolutions because we need not
 create new SRC files for such variables. To introduce new surface
 variables with raw data in new resolutions, the corresponding new SRC
 files need mask equal to 1 everywhere.

 NOTE: Answer-changing modifications have been made in mksurfdata_map,
 but we have NOT recreated the out-of-the-box surface datasets. This
 means that, if you create new surface datasets, you should expect small
 answer changes relative to the current out-of-the-box surface datasets.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #286


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
 These changes are transparent to users making surface datasets using
 default SRC resolutions. Users using non-default SRC resolutions or
 users introducing new surface variables with raw data in non-default
 SRC resolutions, will create new SRC file(s) with mask always set to 1
 everywhere.

 Note, though, that the out-of-the-box surface datasets now differ
 slightly from what you would produce by running mksurfdata_map. So
 answer changes should be expected relative to the out-of-the-box
 surface datasets if you create a new surface dataset.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
 Changed the names of most default SRC files and default map_ files to
 the names of the "nomask" versions of these files.

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 Replaced SRC files and map_ files with "nomask" versions. Most SRC
 resolutions already had nomask files available, so I created such files
 for 0.25x0.25, 0.9x1.25, 3x3min, 5x5min, and 0.125x0.125. I changed all
 of the map_ files except
 map_1km-merge-10min_HYDRO1K-merge-nomask SRC resolution.
 I ran the rimport command as follows:
 ./rimport -list /glade/work/slevis/git/mksurfdata_maps_wo_src_masks/PR_823_new_file_list

Substantial timing or memory changes:
 - We end up with fewer SRC and map_ files by replacing multiple custom
 grids per SRC resolution with one nomask grid. I list here resolutions
 that had multiple custom grids per resolution before the switch to
 nomask:
 0.5x0.5: AVHRR, MODIS, and 360x720cru_cruncep
 3x3min: GLOBE-Gardner-mergeGIS, GLOBE-Gardner, LandScan2004, MODIS-wCsp
 5x5min: IGBP-GSDP, ISRIC-WISE, ORNL
 10x10min_IGBPmergeICESatGIS

 UNSTRUCT info shown for comparison. NOT switching to UNSTRUCT files at
 this time.

 - The nomask map_ files are larger now. E.g.:
2754246572 map_3x3min_GLOBE-Gardner_to_0.9x1.25_nomask_aave_da_c191101.nc  MASKED SCRIP
3051641404 map_3x3min_nomask_to_0.9x1.25_nomask_aave_da_c191109.nc         NOMASK SCRIP
2974797264 map_3x3min_nomask_to_0.9x1.25_nomask_aave_da_c191115.nc         NOMASK UNSTRUCT

 - Although the nomask SCRIP cases shown below are slower because each
 individual mapping file takes longer to create, the total time to
 generate mapping files is reduced, possibly significantly, due to the
 need for fewer mapping files in total. Note the increase in time
 savings from the 0.5x0.5 to the 10x10min resolution, which suggests
 even greater time savings for the 3x3min and 5x5min that went from a
 total of 7 to 2 map_ files. Sample timing data:

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- The out-of-the-box surface datasets now differ slightly from what you
  would produce by running mksurfdata_map. So answer changes should be
  expected relative to the out-of-the-box surface datasets if you create
  a new surface dataset.
- We were not able to run the check_maps tool on the new mapping files:
  this generated a seg fault (see
  https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/823#issuecomment-846248591)

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL
    - what platforms/compilers: ALL
    - nature of change: larger than roundoff/same climate

 For now, model results are unchanged because we are still using the old
 surface datasets. However, this tag changes answers in any new surface
 datasets that are created.

 I performed testing at the 0.9x1.25 degree resolution.

 Code changes were tested by comparing baseline files (a)
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.nc
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.log
 generated by running baseline code pointing to masked map_ files
 to (b)
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_new_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.nc
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_new_hist_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.log
 generated by running the new code still pointing to masked map_ files
 and then comparing to (c)
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_nomask_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.nc
 surfdata_0.9x1.25_nomask_78pfts_CMIP6_simyr2000_c191101.log
 generated by running the new code pointing to nomask map_ files.

 We set an expectation of max abs relative differences of less than
 roughly 1e-13. I got an actual max abs relative difference of 7e-12 in
 PCT_NAT_PFT for (a) vs (b) and (a) vs (c). I refer to these here as
 small diffs.

 All other variables gave smaller diffs except the four VIC variables
 binfil, Ws, Ds, Dsmax between (b) and (c). These diffs appear in 5 grid
 cells (along two meridians that got shifted in longitude by less than
 1e-13 degrees) that vic considers land in the baseline and
 ocean in the nomask case. Vic provides valid generic data for ocean
 grid cells and, therefore, also where the discrepancies occur. This
 means that if the land model treats these grid cells as land, the
 model will work.

 I had to generate new masked map_ files for (a) and (b) because
 changes in ESMF codes over the years were leading to large differences
 between all three (a) vs (b) vs (c). Generating new masked map_ files
 brought the diffs back to small.

 For the 3x3min and 5x5min SRC resolutions, I made six temporary
 nomask SRC files, one per surface variable pointing to 3x3min
 map_ files and one per surface variable pointing to 5x5min map_ files.
 I did this to get small differences relative to the baseline. I created
 the temporary files by making copies of the correspoding masked SRC
 files and changing mask to 1 everywhere. The temporary files had diffs
 less than roughly 1e-5 from generic nomask files generated by running
 mkscripgrid.ncl for 3x3min and 5x5min. Ultimately we are replacing the
 temporary files with the generic nomask files, which leads to larger
 diffs in the surface datasets.

 This testing occurred in late 2019 or early 2020. To confirm the
 results I generated a new set of map_ files for 0.9x1.25 and then
 created new fsurdat files with the baseline code and with the branch.
 Only PCT_NAT_PFT triggers the error check for max abs relative
 diff > 1e-13 with a max abs relative diff = 9e-12.

One-line Summary: Add NEON sites

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Add NEON sites. Add cime/cdeps support and capability to run NEON tower sites.

This also brings in Negin's first version of the subset_data.py script to create
datasets for single-point and regional cases. And a version of it was run to
create the NEON surface datasets.

To setup a NEON site do the following

cd cime/scripts
./create_newcase --case myNEONtest --res CLM_USRDAT --compset IHist1PtClm51Bgc \
--user-mods-dir NEON/NIWO --driver nuopc --run-unsupported

(There's also a I1PtClm51Bgc compset that can be used for fixed conditions)

Note, also that several externals were updated to the version in cesm2_3_alpha03a. This means that
answers change when CISM is turned on. Some of the grids for compsets tested were updated to
use the new grid name "gris" in place of the older "gland".

One-line Summary: Correct vertical interpolation in init_interp when soil thicknesses change

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

 To correct how init_interp handles soil variables with units of kg/m2 or mm
 or mm/s (generally speaking so-called extensive properties), we now add DZSOI
 and a scale_by_thickness flag to restart files. In init_interp we use these to
 scale the vertical interpolation by soil layer thickness.

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #1298

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
 For H2OSOI_LIQ, H2OSOI_ICE, SMP, and HK, from now on init_interp interpolates
 from the soil profile in finidat to the soil profile in the model by
 scaling these variables by dzsoi (layer thickness). This makes the vertical
 interpolation of these variables more accurate. Users need not do anything.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
 From now on newly generated finidat files will contain the scale_by_thickness
 flag and DZSOI for use by the new code. For backwards compatibility, the code
 handles preexisting finidat files by deriving dzsoi from the node depths for
 the four variables listed above.

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

 behaves as expected.

One-line Summary: Misc bfb enhancements and fixes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

(1) If CISM is running over Antarctica, use virtual glacier columns over
    Antarctica

(2) Remove "mec" from some glacier/ice variable names (it is misleading
    to have "mec" in variable names when the ice landunit can actually
    have multiple columns *or* a single column) (ESCOMP/CTSM#1294)

(3) Add history file metadata on each variable's l2g_scale_type (adds a
    landunit_mask attribute) (ESCOMP/CTSM#1343)

(4) Use python3 in more shebang lines - needed to run python unit tests
    on cheyenne

(5) New compset naming for IG compsets (ESCOMP/CTSM#1289)

(6) Remove calculation of fun_cost_fix that is overwritten
    (ESCOMP/CTSM#1115)

(7) Bypass grid-level water mass check when fates hydro is active
    (ESCOMP/CTSM#1334)

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):

Substantial timing or memory changes:
- Increase in land initialization time in the PFS test
  (PFS_Ld20.f09_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel); this is probably
  due to machine variability because I don't think any of the changes in
  this tag would have any significant impact on model initialization
  time.

One-line Summary: Bring in Arctic changes to LUNA from Leah Birch

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This is @lmbirch89 branch from #947 with the exception that Kattge is used in place of
Leuning in LUNA. Also the startup initial values in the luna bug fix branch #961 is
used in place of the updated values by @lmbirch89. The LUNA bug fixes have already come
in, so these are some changes to improve arctic plants.

We have addressed the issues in phenology and photosynthesis in the high latitudes.
Development was focused on PFT specific differences and we used observations to inform
model development. GPP is improved now such that the tundra is realistically less
productive than the boreal forest.

  #1346 -- Use of floating point flag onset_thresh is confusing in CNPhenologyMod

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   New namelist items: onset_thresh_depends_on_veg and min_crtical_dayl_depends_on_lat

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  reseed_dead_plants turned on when AD spinup mode turned on
  onset_thresh_depends_on_veg and min_crtical_dayl_depends_on_lat turned on for clm5_1 physics

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  New parameter file (same as start used in PPE work) also has additional fields on it

Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide
[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  As noted in #1346 some of the logic in CNPhenology in CNSeasonDecidPhenology is a bit confusing.
   The soil layer used was put in CNSharedParameters and needed it's own subroutine to prevent circular dependencies.
   There are new accumulator variables added that area always turned on even when not needed. Doing this
   in a reasonable manner (without having lots of CNPhenology logic spilled into base types) would require
   a refactoring of a better way to figure this out.

One-line Summary: Remove unnecessary settings of nextsw_cday

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Remove setting of nextsw_cday in initialization: this hasn't been needed
ever since we stopped calculating albedos in initialization.

Also remove nextsw_cday from clm_time_manager: this was being set but
was never referenced from here: instead, nextsw_cday was being passed as
an argument to clm_drv.

Also, updates cime to a branch tag where I have fixed the --retry option
to create_test.

One-line Summary: Fix bugs in co2 from atmosphere

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

ctsm5.1.dev002 introduced bugs when receiving co2 from the atmosphere,
both for mct and nuopc:
- For mct, with spatially-varying co2 from atmosphere, all grid cells on
  a given processor were given the co2 value from the last grid cell on
  that processor
- For nuopc, co2 from atmosphere was ignored and overridden with a
  constant co2 value

This tag fixes both of those bugs.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Cases where CTSM receives CO2 from atmosphere
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      potentially new climate

   Answer changes due to fixing these issues:
   - For mct, with spatially-varying co2 from atmosphere, all grid cells on
     a given processor were given the co2 value from the last grid cell on
     that processor
   - For nuopc, co2 from atmosphere was ignored and overridden with a
     constant co2 value

   In the test suite, this leads to changes in:
   - ERP_D_Ld10_P36x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm51BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-ciso_decStart
   - ERS_Ly3_P72x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput
   - SMS_D_Ln9_P480x1_Vnuopc.f19_g17.IHistClm50Sp.cheyenne_intel.clm-waccmx_offline

   But more widespread changes are expected - including for mct - if
   coupled runs can generate spatially-varying co2 from atm

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES (but very limited)

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: NUOPC driver with CISM
    - what platforms/compilers: cheyenne_intel; maybe others
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): roundoff

    For an unknown reason, the new externals lead to small differences
    in global sums in the CMEPS driver/mediator. For what we assume is
    the same reason, lnd -> glc fields can change by roundoff (probably
    due to the global renormalization).

    The only test in the aux_clm test suite where this shows up is
    ERS_Ly3_P72x2_Vnuopc.f10_f10_mg37.IHistClm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

One-line Summary: New single column functionality for the NUOPC cap

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Implemented new nuopc/cmeps single column functionality.

In config/cesm/config_files.xml - single point domains are only used
for mct/cpl7. For cmeps single point meshes are now generated on the
fly and component domains files are no longer needed.
env_run.xml variables PTS_LAT, PTS_LON and PTS_DOMAINFILE are used
to determine if there is a single point or single column run.
If PTS_LAT and PTS_LON are not -999 and PTS_DOMAINFILE is UNSET,
then you have a single point run and the exact values of PTS_LAT
and PTS_LON are used.  If PTS_LAT and PTS_LON are not -999 and
PTS_DOMAINFILE is not UNSET, then then the cmeps driver will recognize the nearest neighbor
values of PTS_LAT and PTS_LON in PTS_DOMAINFILE as the single column lat and lon to use.

[Remove any lines that don't apply. Remove entire section if nothing applies.]

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
  Nine step tests changed so that they have ROF run at same frequency as ATM (like the similar CAM tests)
  as these will fail with NUOPC since it doesn't allow you to end not on an even time-step for all components.
  One of these tests changed to a CAM type test from decStart

      For nuopc: changes in area (relatively large differences in the
      f10 test in the test suite, but Mariana saw only very small
      changes in an f09 case), landfrac; these influence l2r fields,
      which in turn influence TWS and methane fields.

      For lilac: just changes in area

One-line Summary: Change limitation of top layer evaporation/sublimation

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Sublimation from top soil layer and evaporation/sublimation from top
snow layer needs to be limited to ensure moisture states do not become
negative. The original formulation did not always work, so we added a
new limitation to SoilFluxesMod.

Also removes a limitation in SoilHydrologyMod that seemed not to
conserve energy and should no longer be necessary with the reworked
limitation in SoilFluxesMod.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- The old flux limitation in SoilHydrologyMod has been replaced by a
  truncation of roundoff-level values followed by a check that the final
  state is non-negative. Although this check hasn't been triggered in
  any of our testing, it's possible that we'll run into situations where
  we need to relax the tolerance for this check.

One-line Summary: Update cime and other externals; includes switch to pio2

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Updates cime and other externals to version in cesm2_3_alpha02b (with
some minor changes to cime on top of that). This includes substantial
changes to cime, including switching to PIO2 rather than PIO1.

Also:

- For LILAC, changes default pio_rearranger now that we're using PIO2 by
  default

- In run_sys_tests, adds '-k oed' to qsub command on cheyenne; this is
  useful now that qpeek is disabled on cheyenne (this puts the job's
  stdout and stderr files directly in their final location from the
  beginning, rather than keeping them in some temporary location on the
  compute node until the job completes)

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1175 (Once there is a cime tag with pio2 as the
  default, update to it)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1194 (Once we switch to pio2 by default, change
  the default rearranger used in LILAC)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- PIO2 is now the default. This has been tested extensively, but let us
  know if you run into any I/O related issues. Also, from testing we've
  done, I/O performance looks better than with PIO1 in many cases, but
  also let us know if you see a substantial degradation in I/O
  performance.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
- Some I/O-related defaults change with the use of PIO2 rather than PIO1

Substantial timing or memory changes:
- Various changes due to the change to PIO2, some of them large. For the
  most part, timing improves with PIO2, particularly for production
  resolutions.
- The PFS test and many others show a substantial improvement in timing.
  This is especially noticeable in initialization time. For example, the
  initialization time of
  PFS_Ld20.f09_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel dropped from 111 sec
  to 34 sec. (These tests were run a couple of weeks apart, before and
  after a cheyenne upgrade, so there may be some machine variability in
  these numbers, but I saw a big improvement a few months ago with a
  more objective comparison.)

 Explanation: Moving call BalanceCheck to after the call lnd2glc in
 subroutine clm_drv causes a change in order of operations that leads to
 roundoff change in ERRH2O. Confirmed by running ./summarize_cprnc_diffs

One-line Summary: Calculate leaf biomass for non-woody PFTS, and a few other small answer changes

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

Replace hard code constant 0.25 for leaf mass per area with calculation based on parameter slatop (specific leaf area, top of
canopy). Also move num_iter into loop over patches; currently it sits outside a loop, so p index is incorrect.

Also do some small answer changes in terms of new parameter files, and some other existing issues that have mild answer changes.

One-line Summary: Merge fates_main_api into ctsm master

Purpose and description of changes
----------------------------------

This brings fates_main_api into and up-to-date with ctsm master.
At the point of merge, fates_main_api was parallel with ctsm5.1.dev020,
only one tag behind ctsm master's head.

The purpose of this merge is to make all future updates to fates
on the ctsm master branch instead of on the fates_main_api branch.

Known bugs found since the previous tag (include issue #):
   #1269 -- GSWP3V1 atmospheric forcing for 2011-2014 is "bad" over Antarctica

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
  - fates_spitfire_mode updated with multiple modes that use external datasets
  - use_fates_cohort_age_tracking added to enable size and age dependent mortality
  - fates_parteh_mode option 2 added for fates CNP mode

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files):
  fates_paramfile updated to fates_params_api.14.0.0_12pft_c200921.nc

Substantial timing or memory changes:
  Only the fates testmod FatesAllVars failed the MEMCOMP test due to the increase in the number of variables included


Notes of particular relevance for developers:
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   There are a couple of issues we plan to address later (#1265, and #1272)
    Note also that NAG compiler production tests started failing because of a compiler error
    Since, we only care about NAG for DEBUG testing we removed those tests. Hopefully, a compiler
    update will allow that to work in the future.

Changes to tests or testing:
  - Added FatesPRT2 testmod test which activates fates CNP mode
  - Added FatesReducedComplexFixedBiogeo testmod which activates fates fixed biogeography mode
  - Added FatesSizeAgeMort testmod which activates tracking of size and age dependent mortality in fates
  - Added Fates_nat_and_anthro_ignitions testmod to activate use of external lightning and population datasets
  - Non-debug mode nag tests replaced in izumi test list with debug versions due to internal compiler error.

One-line Summary: Add option for biomass heat storage (BHS) to clm5_1 physics

Purpose of changes
------------------

Add heat stored in biomass (for trees and shrubs) to the surface energy balance calculation. Add
a switch for it and turn it on by default for clm5_1 physics. It's turned off for clm4_5, clm5_0
physics and when FATES is turned on. Those cases are identical to before, answers only change
when it's turned on.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
    New variables are added on the restart files (stem/leaf biomass and stem Temp)
    Testing didn't show this as a problem, but theoretically could require
       updating initial conditions

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): New compsets, new hist fields
   I1850Clm51BgcCrop
   I1850Clm51Bgc
   History fields: AGSB, AGLB, FSH_STEM, DHDT_CANOPY, RAH1, RAH2, RAW1, RAW2, USTAR, UM, UAF, UM, UAF,
       TAF, QAF, OBU, ZETA, VPD, num_iter, RB, TSTEM
   DHSDT_CANOPY, TSTEM are default active

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): New use_biomass_heat_storage
   New namelist item: use_biomass_heat_storage to turn on or off (by default only on for clm5_1
   physics for both SP and BGC modes)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): New parameter datasets
   All of the params files were updated. New terms were BHS parameters and taper
   stocking is now set as "nstem" on the parameter file
   taper is now on the parameter file

Substantial timing or memory changes: Doesn't seem to
   Only one short test failed the TPUTCOMP test
   Longer tests were not significantly different

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   Setting of leaf/stem biomass should be refactored and removed from CanopyFluxes (as described in #1247)
   There's a change in CNGapMortality that could change for DV when AD mode is on
   Stability cap (zera) is different for BHS on than off

Changes to tests or testing: New CLM51 FATES test

CTSM testing: regular

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

One-line Summary: Potential roundoff changes in preparation for bio-mass heat storage option

Purpose of changes
------------------

This adds in some changes that may be roundoff different in preparation for bringing in the changes
that allow turning on the bio-mass heat storage option. There's a few zeroed terms added to some calculations
in CanopyFluxes. The new terms are identical to what will come in for BHS except the zeroed terms are
not arrays here but scalars. I showed the new terms are only off by roundoff with a previous commit that added
explicit tests for the terms and verified it for two tests.

One-line Summary: Allow pnetcdf for vector history files

Purpose of changes
------------------

Ever since clm4_5_1_r091, we had been avoiding the use of pnetcdf for
vector history files (i.e., history files with dov2xy = .false.). This
was to workaround an issue that was found on the old yellowstone
supercomputer (bugzilla 1730). However, I cannot reproduce this issue on
cheyenne, either with PIO1 or with PIO2. Moreover, the workaround was
leading to very slow performance with PIO2, at least for some
tests. This tag removes that old workaround.

See https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/33 for details.

Also change PE layouts for C96 and C192. The main motivation for this is
to get the aux_clm C96 test through the queue faster (the current test
sometimes waits for multiple hours in the queue):

(1) Make the out-of-the-box PE counts unthreaded, as is standard for I
    compsets

(2) In the aux_clm test for C92, use a 360x2 PE layout: Use a PE layout
    that (a) has threading, because CAM uses threading at this
    resolution; and (b) has a smaller-than-standard task count in order
    to get through the queue faster.

Substantial timing or memory changes:

   Timing changes seem small, though not investigated carefully. No
   timing changes are expected to show up in the PFS test (because it
   doesn't do history output), but I looked at a few other non-debug f09
   cases: ERP_Ld5.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.cheyenne_intel.clm-vrtlay,
   ERP_Ld3.f09_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCropCru.cheyenne_intel.clm-ciso,
   ERS_Ld3.f09_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-rad_hrly_light_res_half,
   ERS_Ld3.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Fates.cheyenne_intel.clm-FatesColdDef. Total
   runtime of these increased in some tests and decreased in others
   relative to the baseline, but on average, there was little change
   relative to the baseline. I have more carefully investigated this
   change in the context of pio2, which will soon become the default:
   with pio2, this change is important to get good performance.

One-line Summary: Change CISM2%NOEVOLVE compsets to use SGLC; documentation updates

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Change CISM2%NOEVOLVE compsets to use SGLC.

The use of CISM2%NOEVOLVE adds complexity and (perhaps most importantly)
increases the turnaround time of CTSM software testing, while adding
only marginal scientific value. Therefore, we are changing I compsets to
use a stub glacier (SGLC) rather than CISM2%NOEVOLVE for now. Within the
next year, we'd like to have these use a data glc model, but that will
most likely wait until we switch to using NUOPC by default (so we can
use a data glc in CDEPS: ESCOMP/CDEPS#25).

This tag changes the meaning of compset aliases that previously had
neither a Gs (for stub glacier) or G (for CISM2%EVOLVE), so that they
now use a stub glacier (SGLC) rather than CISM2%NOEVOLVE. Compset
aliases that previously had Gs (so were already using a stub glacier)
have been changed so that there is no longer a Gs in the alias: stub
glacier is now the implied default.

This change reduces our test build time to 40% of what it previously
was! When I ran the test suite for ctsm5.1.dev010, the cheyenne-intel
test suite (by far the largest of our test suites) took 5 hours, 8 min
to build. In yesterday's run of the test suite with this change in
place, the cheyenne-intel test suite took only 2 hours, 6 min to build!
The final test in this test suite finished running just 2 hours, 29 min
after I started the test suite. This may not be a completely fair
comparison, because the machine may have been relatively lightly loaded
during this Sunday afternoon run, but I wouldn't expect the test suite
build time (which is what I'm reporting here) to be hugely impacted by
that.

Changes due to using SGLC in place of CISM2%NOEVOLVE are documented
here:
<https://escomp.github.io/cism-docs/cism-in-cesm/versions/master/html/clm-cism-coupling.html?highlight=sglc#stub-glc-model-cism-absent>.

(2) Documentation updates

Brings in a new optional external, doc-builder, to assist with building
the documentation, specifically with a new Docker-based workflow
documented here
<https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/wiki/Directions-for-editing-CLM-documentation-on-github-and-sphinx>.

Also updates LILAC documentation and a bit more.

      The changes arise from changes in the meaning of

      with Gs in their alias) have the same meaning as before, but a
      different compset alias (so in testing, this resulted in BFAILs
      due to missing baselines). Configurations that previously used
      CISM2%NOEVOLVE (which included most of our standard
      configurations) now instead use a stub GLC. This results in
      differences over Greenland (in ways described here:
      <https://escomp.github.io/cism-docs/cism-in-cesm/versions/master/html/clm-cism-coupling.html?highlight=sglc#stub-glc-model-cism-absent>).

Main change is to fix the reading of a variable that is one type on a
NetCDF file but a different data type in memory. Previously, this could
lead to memory corruption (not just of the variable in question, but
other variables as well). This was not causing any problems in
out-of-the-box configurations, but it sometimes tripped up some
developers when they added new fields on datasets.

In addition, this adds new self-test code to test ncdio_pio. This module
is hard to get under unit test, but we want to have some tests of it, to
pick up problems like the one fixed in this tag. So as a compromise
solution for now, I have introduced unit test-like tests that are built
into a standard build of CTSM and run in a standard run if a given
namelist flag is set. A better long-term solution would be to integrate
these tests into the pFUnit-based unit testing framework, but that would
take some work. I have added tests of the new code, and a bit of testing
of other code in ncdio_pio, but there's still a lot in ncdio_pio that is
not tested. I figure we can gradually add tests as we make changes to
ncdio_pio.

Finally, an unrelated change to the unit test build: files generated by
genf90 now appear in the unit test build directory rather than the
source tree.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1091 (Memory corruption when reading a netcdf
  variable into a variable of a different type, at least with PIO1)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1188 (In unit test build: files generated by
  genf90 should go in build dir rather than source dir)

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Ideally the ncdio_pio self-tests would be recoded as true unit tests,
  leveraging the pFUnit framework. This would get them out of the main
  source code, and would give other benefits that come with a real unit
  testing framework, such as that a single failure doesn't abort the
  entire test suite.
- The existence of tests for ncdio_pio should NOT be taken as a sign
  that all (or even most) of this module is now under unit test: in
  fact, much of it is not covered yet by my new testing module.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a test that triggers for_testing_run_ncdiopio_tests

One-line Summary: CNFire: btran2 fixes and general cleanup

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Call routine to calculate fire's btran2 from CNFireArea; this has a
    few advantages:

    - It makes the logic of CNFireArea more clear (rather than depending on
      a btran2 variable that is calculated from some other part of the code)

    - This avoids having the biogeophysics depend on the biogeochemistry

    - This lets us avoid doing this btran calc if using no-fire – or other,
      future, fire methods that don't need it

    Note regarding testing: In the initial step, I kept this calculation
    dependent on a saved version of h2osoi_vol to avoid changing
    answers; I changed this in the answer changes in step (2), as noted
    below.

(2) Answer-changing fixes to CNFire's btran2 calculation and use:

    (a) Calculate fire btran2 using updated h2osoi_vol (this is an
        answer-changing cleanup step from (1))

    (b) TEMPORARY CHANGE (reverted in the cleanup in (3)): Reinitialize
        fire btran2 to spval for all patches in each time step, so that
        the fire code isn't trying to use btran2 from earlier time steps
        for patches that were in the exposed veg filter at one point but
        no longer are.

        One implication of this is that, if there is currently no
        exposed veg on a column, the new code leads to the block of code
        that forces fire_m = 0 (because wtlf will be 0). Previously, in
        contrast, it looks like fire_m was allowed to be non-zero even
        if there is currently no exposed veg, because btran2 and wtlf
        were accumulated if a patch ever was exposed in the past.

    (c) Limit fire btran2 to be <= 1, rather than letting it be slightly
        greater than 1. (Due to a conditional in CNFireArea, these
        slightly-greater-tan-1 values were being ignored when computing
        btran_col, rather than averaging in a 1 value.)

(3) Non-answer-changing fire code cleanup:

    (a) Cleanup of the btran2 fixes, including reverting the TEMPORARY
        CHANGE noted in (2b), instead relying on a better mechanism:
        just doing the calculations of btran_col and wtlf over the
        exposedvegp filter. Also, get rid of the checks for
        shr_infnan_isnan(btran2(p)) and btran2(p) <= 1 (allowed by the
        other changes in (2) and (3)).

    (b) Set btran2 to 0 over non-exposed-veg points: this changes
        answers for the BTRAN2 diagnostic field, but nothing else. (This
        follows what is done for the standard BTRAN.)

    (c) Move calc_fire_root_wetness for CNFireLi2021 into the base type
        to avoid future bugs (assuming that the next fire module will
        extend the base class but will also want to use this new version
        of calc_fire_root_wetness).

    (d) Change fire looping structure to be more standard

(4) Remove some very expensive tests from aux_clm, putting some in the
    new ctsm_sci test list instead

(5) A bit of other minor cleanup

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1139 (Decrease expense of ne0ARCTICGRISne30x8
  test and C96 tests)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1153 (Fire btran2 is only computed for exposed
  veg patches, but is used over all veg patches)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1170 (CNFire code: btran2 should not be skipped
  when it's greater than 1)
- Partially addresses ESCOMP/CTSM#1142 (Add ctsm_sci test list that
  would be used for releases and making sure important resolutions run
  well)

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, for all CN/BGC configurations

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All CN/BGC configurations
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      larger than roundoff; expected to be same climate, but not
      investigated yet


  To verify that the answer changes only came from expected changes, I
  did a few rounds of testing. The following numbers refer to the groups
  of changes listed under "Purpose of changes", above. The changes in
  groups (4) and (5) were combined with those in groups (1) and (3) -
  i.e., the basically non-answer-changing sets.

  First, I tested with just the changes in (1). This led to differences
  in only limited configurations, as noted in
  https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1155#issuecomment-695035048:
  - nofire tests had diffs in BTRAN2
  - dynroots tests had extensive diffs because now btran2 is calculated
    after the dyn roots updates in each time step
  - tests where the compared clm2 h0 file includes the 0th time step had
    diffs just in BTRAN2, for reasons I couldn't determine

  Then I tested with the changes in (2), which were expected to change
  answers for all CN/BGC tests. In particular, these change answers due
  to:
  - using updated h2osoi_vol rather than the one earlier in the time
    step when calculating btran2
  - only considering points in the exposed veg filter when averaging
    btran2 from patch to column, rather than using stale values from
    no-longer-exposed patches (which also means having fire_m = 0 if
    there are no currently-exposed veg patches in a column) (fix for
    ESCOMP/CTSM#1153)
  - treating btran2 values that are slightly greater than 1 as 1, rather
    than ignoring them completely (fix for ESCOMP/CTSM#1170)

  Finally, I tested with all of the changes, comparing against the
  baselines generated from (2). As expected, the only answer changes in
  this final round were in the BTRAN2 diagnostic field (due to setting
  btran2 to 0 over non-exposed-veg points).

One-line Summary: Improve robustness of onset and offset counters when changing dt

Purpose of changes
------------------

The logic in CNPhenology for onset_counter and offset_counter was not
robust when the model time step differed from the time step used to
generate the finidat file. This showed up when running with a 20-minute
time step using a finidat file that was generated with a 30-minute time
step. See https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1163 for details.

The fix here improves the situation significantly, but I believe still
leaves some issues remaining; see
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1167 for details.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1163 (onset_counter variable on (all?) restart
  files is not compatible with subsequent model runs using a 20 minute
  time step)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
- ESCOMP/CTSM#1167 (Rework CNPhenology onset and offset triggers to be
  more robust to changes in dt)
  - This issue was not exactly introduced in this tag, but it captures
    some things that I think still need to be done for complete robustness

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, but in very limited circumstances

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Only when the model run uses a different
      time step than the initial conditions file
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      larger than roundoff; magnitude not investigated; in some cases,
      the differences might be significant if the model actually
      continues without aborting

    In the aux_clm test suite, this only appears in one test:
      SMS_Ln9.ne30pg2_ne30pg2_mg17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-clm50cam6LndTuningMode

    but it might appear more widely in cam / fully coupled testing

One-line Summary: Add capability for dynamic lakes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Adds the capability for dynamic lake areas, read from the
landuse_timeseries file. This represents reservoir construction. For
now, this capability is off by default. Turning it on requires new
fields on the landuse_timeseries file which cannot yet be produced by
mksurfdata_map; these new fields will be added in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073.

A substantial part of this tag involved changing the accounting of water
and energy in lakes in order to conserve water and energy across
landunit transitions while not producing too large adjustment
fluxes. This change results in roundoff-level answer changes for all
transient cases.

The core changes in this tag are from Inne Vanderkelen, in consultation
with Bill Sacks. Additional changes are from Bill Sacks, in consultation
with Inne Vanderkelen.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#200 (Count energy of water in lakes in total
  gridcell heat content)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1140 (Add lake water to dynbal baselines)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Using the dynamic lakes functionality will require either the
  mksurfdata_map changes in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073 or
  manually adding the necessary fields to the landuse_timeseries file.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variable for transient runs: do_transient_lakes

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Using the dynamic lakes functionality will require either the
  mksurfdata_map changes in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073 or
  manually adding the necessary fields to the landuse_timeseries file.
- For this reason, the new test
  (ERS_Lm25.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHistClm50BgcCropQianRsGs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly)
  requires a manual step to create the necessary landuse_timeseries
  file. This step is documented in the README file for the
  clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly testmod.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a single-point test covering dynamic lakes, using a
  manually-created landuse_timeseries file:
  ERS_Lm25.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHistClm50BgcCropQianRsGs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly

CTSM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - ok

    Tests pass, differences from baseline as expected due to new
    namelist variable

  tools-tests (test/tools):

    cheyenne - not run

  PTCLM testing (tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

    cheyenne - not run

  python testing (see instructions in python/README.md; document testing done):

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):
  And always remove these three lines and parts that don't apply.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Transient cases
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):
      Mostly roundoff-level. See below for details.

      - Differences in HEAT_CONTENT1, ICE_CONTENT1, LIQUID_CONTENT1, as
        expected

      - In transient tests (including Hist/SSP, Fates, CNDV and
        transient glacier), roundoff-level diffs in EFLX_DYNBAL,
        QFLX_ICE_DYNBAL and QFLX_LIQ_DYNBAL, along with related flux
        terms, and river volume

      - In some transient tests, roundoff-level diffs in methane terms,
        presumably from downstream effects of changes in VOLR due to
        roundoff-level changes in fluxes. In multi-year tests, these
        methane diffs grow to bigger than roundoff-level, but I think
        they originate from roundoff-level diffs. (I feel like I've seen
        this high sensitivity before.)

      - glcMEC_increase test
        (ERP_P180x2_D_Ld5.f19_g17_gl4.I1850Clm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-glcMEC_increase)
        shows significant differences in river-related terms, maybe due
        to glacier running over lake and now lake has different states
        than before; also, FILLDIFFs in h1 file because lake remains
        active even when it goes to 0 area.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?
   - Examined cprnc RMS diffs

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

 Eliminate duplication of the "derived quantities for required fields"
 and corresponding error checking codes that repeat across the mct,
 nuopc, and lilac caps. This consolidates the code and reduces
 maintenance requirements.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: Larger than roundoff/same climate


Detailed list of changes
------------------------

 Changes were implemented in three steps:

 1) Bit-for-bit: @billsacks simplified subroutine QSat by making three
 arguments optional (es, qsdT, esdT).

 2) Answer-changing: @slevisconsulting replaced local calculations of
 qsat in /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc with calls to
 CTSM's subroutine QSat. Subroutine QSat uses a higher-order polynomial
 approximation to estimate qsat, which explains the larger than
 round-off diffs. When moving the three identical local approximations
 to QSat as a temporary test instead of using the higher-order
 polynomial approximation, the diffs reduce to round-off.

 3) Bit-for-bit: @slevisconsulting consolidated repeating codes in
 /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc by placing in the new
 file /src/utils/lnd_import_export_utils.F90.

One-line Summary: Start the clm5_1 physics series, with some changes to the fire model from Fang Li

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fang Li's latest Fire version - includes allowing clm5.1 phys version. New physics option is added
called "clm5_1", with currently the new feature to use the latest fire changes. This has some
adjustments to the fire model and includes some changes to the parameter file. Other new features
will be added into clm5_1 in future tags.

Also bring in mksurfdata changes for the raw urban dataset change. This adds some changes to
mksurfdata for a new urban raw dataset, as well as preparation for new changes for some other
urban changes that will be a future part of clm5_1. Also use the half degree lightning dataset
by default for clm5_1.

Start adding a new test list ctsm_sci that tests all the scientifically supported compsets.
Some of those tests fail due to existing issues, that will be fixed later.

Some more work done to change clm to ctsm, and allow for ctsm as a component.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
  Fix #1142 -- Add ctsm_sci test list
  Fix #1145 -- File was corrupted on glade
  Fix #1144 -- Move btran2 to just inside of fire model
  Fix #889 --- Some adjustments to the Li Fire model
