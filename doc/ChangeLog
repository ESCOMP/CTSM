One-line Summary: Set tracer version of irrigation fluxes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Set tracer version of irrigation fluxes.

This required a substantial rewrite of ApplyIrrigation (now renamed to
CalcIrrigationFluxes). The problem was that the code was written to
compute the total irrigation withdrawal from groundwater, then use this
to compute the application fluxes (drip/sprinkler), then later divide
this total withdrawal by layer. But for tracer fluxes to be computed
correctly, we needed to reorder this, so that the per-layer withdrawals
are determined before determining the application fluxes. This is
because the application flux needs to know the tracer concentrations of
the source, which requires knowing which layers the source is drawing
from. This was made more challenging because of the mix of patch-level
and column-level variables at play: irrigation demand is patch-level,
groundwater availability and extraction is column-level, but application
is back to patch-level.

In a somewhat-related change, I also reworked the passing of information
between soil hydrology (groundwater availability) and irrigation:
Previously, there was some near-duplicate code in
CalcAvailableUnconfinedAquifer (which was called prior to
ApplyIrrigation) and WithdrawGroundwaterIrrigation (which was called
after ApplyIrrigation). I have reworked the code to remove this
duplication, calling the new CalcIrrigWithdrawals in the midst of
CalcIrrigationFluxes. In doing so, I reconciled an accidental
discrepancy between the two original routines (see
https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/issues/595).

    ok means tests pass, expected baseline failures as noted below

  Additional manual testing:

  - Out of the box, the one-timestep tracer consistency test
    (SMS_D_Ln1.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCropGs.hobart_nag.clm-tracer_consistency)
    passed when the new check was inserted after the irrigation call,
    even without the changes in this tag. Presumably this is because no
    irrigation was being done in the first time step of this test. To
    confirm that the changes here were both necessary and effective, I
    hacked the code to force irrigation of all types (surface and
    groundwater) on the first time step (see
    https://github.com/billsacks/ctsm/commit/d28a03145). I confirmed
    that this test, with those code hacks, failed before the changes in
    this tag, and passed with these changes in place.

  - I used a multi-step process to confirm that these changes are only
    roundoff-level different for groundwater irrigation (because
    feedbacks in the system result in
    SMS_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.hobart_nag.clm-irrig_alternate
    looking greater-than-roundoff-level different from the baseline):

    (1) Confirmed that e507fe603 is only roundoff-level different from
        baseline using cprnc output from this test.

    (2) Confirmed that a4a1a626c is only roundoff-level different from
        e507fe603. This was the tricky part. I did this by introducing
        some temporary code that (a) computed some fluxes in both the
        old and new ways, (b) compared the old and new methods for each
        point and time step, confirming that they were no more than
        roundoff-level different, then (c) set the fluxes to the old
        method. I confirmed that this was bit-for-bit with e507fe603,
        and the checks for greater-than-roundoff-level differences
        between the old and new methods were never triggered. (See
        https://github.com/billsacks/ctsm/commit/7d23e9e and the earlier
        commits on that branch.)

    (3) Confirmed that remaining changes an the branch are bit-for-bit
        with a4a1a626c.

    - what code configurations:

      - Small answer changes when groundwater irrigation is enabled. In
        principle, could change answers by greater than roundoff due to
        fix of #595, but I didn't see any answer changes in my 7-month

One-line Summary: Added tracer ratio capability and included it in consistency checks

Purpose of changes
------------------

These changes are needed to support the implementation of water isotopes by ensuring
that isotope-related variables are being updated consistently throughout the model.
The consistency checks include the testing of a bulk tracer that should always be
equal to the bulk, and also test tracers that maintain a fixed ratio (other than 
one) to the bulk.  This commit includes fixes to the cold start initialization for 
the water tracers with ratios other than one.

One-line Summary: New options for irrigation and crop fsat

Purpose of changes
------------------

Introduce three new options:

(1) Ability to withdraw irrigation water from groundwater if not enough
    water is available from rivers. This is controlled via new namelist
    flag, use_groundwater_irrigation. Water can be withdrawn from both
    the unconfined (from the soil column) and confined (from wa)
    aquifers.

(2) Irrigation method: sprinkler (above canopy) vs. drip (below
    canopy). This can be set on a per-crop and per-gridcell basis on the
    surface dataset, but out-of-the-box support for creating the
    necessary surface dataset field is not yet in place (see
    ESCOMP/ctsm#565). For now, it can be controlled globally via a new
    namelist flag, irrig_method_default. The default is drip, which was
    what we were previously using implicitly.

(3) Set crop fsat to zero. This is controlled by a new namelist option,
    crop_fsat_equals_zero.

Default behavior is the same as before for all three options.

Also:

- If use_aquifer_layer is false (which is the default for CLM50), no
  longer reset wa_col every time step

- Adds indices to vector history files giving column, landunit and
  gridcell indices for each patch, etc. (Resolves ESCOMP/ctsm#81:
  "Restart files are different for CLM when run over different number of
  tasks" (issue name is a misnomer of the remaining to-dos in that
  issue.)

- Writes 3d time-constant fields on first history file for all tapes,
  not just the first

- Small performance improvements to irrigation

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: ctsm1.0.dev019


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Some CLM50 cases that are either cold start
      or (unusually) use a CLM45 initial conditions file; it's possible
      that non-cold-start configurations would see differences rarely.
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Larger than roundoff, same climate

      Differences arise due to no longer resetting wa_col to
      aquifer_water_baseline every time step in BeginWaterBalanceSingle
      if use_aquifer_layer is false (which is the default for
      CLM50). (This change is needed to conserve water properly with the
      new groundwater-based irrigation.) For the most part, wa_col
      wasn't being changed when use_aquifer_layer is false (so no longer
      resetting it has no effect if groundwater irrigation isn't being
      used), but the one exception is the "work around of the negative
      liquid water" added by Jinyun Tang in subroutine SoilWater (dated
      Jan 14, 2015), which can be exercised when use_flexibleCN is
      true. Sean Swenson did some experimentation, and found that the
      code that updates wa_col is only exercised in the first time step
      of a cold start run, and that finding is borne out in the test
      suite results. However, it's possible that there are rare cases
      when this is exercised later in a run.

      I have confirmed that this branch is bit-for-bit with the baseline
      if I revert the addition of the use_aquifer_layer conditional
      around the wa_col resetting in
      BeginWaterBalanceSingle. Alternatively, nearly all tests are
      bit-for-bit with the baseline if I remove the one line updating
      wa_col in subroutine SoilWater (and also remove the endrun for
      water balance errors from BalanceCheck); the one exception is the
      waccmx_offline test, which uses a CLM45 initial conditions file in
      a CLM50 configuration.

      The following tests had baseline failures:

      Cold start tests:

         ERP_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.IHistClm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-allActive
         ERP_D_P36x2_Ld3.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropColdStart

         ERP_P72x2_Lm25.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcDvCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-monthly

      configuration:

         ERS_D_Ln9_P480x3.f19_g16.I2000Clm50SpGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-waccmx_offline

One-line Summary: Rework cold start initialization of wa and zwt

Purpose of changes
------------------

Rework cold start initialization of wa and zwt when use_aquifer_layer is
false to reduce answer changes in upcoming groundwater_irrigation
branch.

In the groundwater_irrigation branch
(https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/pull/523), Sean Swenson has stopped
resetting wa_col each time step if use_aquifer_layer is false. However,
this leads to having a substantially different value of wa_col when
use_aquifer_layer is false: previously, it was reset to
aquifer_water_baseline each time step, but with Sean's changes, it stays
close to its initial values, which have been 4000 in most places. This
tag changes the initial values to match the value it was being reset to,
so it simply starts at aquifer_water_baseline - so the
every-time-step-resetting to aquifer_water_baseline can be removed
without massively changing the value of wa_col.

In addition to changing the cold start initialization of wa_col, we are
also changing the cold start initialization of zwt in this case where
use_aquifer_layer is false: The old initialization of zwt wouldn't work
as intended now that we have changed the initial value of wa_col; Sean
Swenson suggested this new initialization method instead. This
initialization to zi(c,nbedrock(c)) is correct if there are no saturated
layers, and close enough for a decent cold start even if there are.

One-line Summary: Water tracer updates for initial things in driver loop

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update water tracers for initial stuff done in driver loop. This includes
atm2lnd forcings (non-downscaled and downscaled), balance check initialization,
and dyn subgrid updates.

Broadly speaking, the changes here are:

(1) Reworked WaterType to make it easier / more robust for other code to loop
    over tracers or bulk+tracers

(2) The most interesting changes are probably the code to update the atm2lnd
    water tracers (in Wateratm2lndType.F90 and WaterTracerUtils.F90)

(3) In various other places, do some infrastructurey stuff (initializing water
    balance, doing dyn subgrid stuff) for tracers as well as bulk

(4) Supporting unit tests and unit test infrastructure

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- We have chosen not to set all water tracers as soon as possible, but instead
  to do these tracer settings later in the driver loop. This keeps the driver
  loop cleaner, but means that you cannot arbitrarily sprinkle calls to
  TracerConsistencyCheck throughout the driver. Specifically for this tag: the
  non-downscaled, gridcell-level atm2lnd water tracers are not updated until
  after the call to downscale_forcings, so tracer consistency checks before that
  point would fail.

One-line Summary: Merge the collapse2gencrop branch

Purpose of changes
------------------

These changes allow the model to not need to read 16-pft
datasets and rather read 78-pft datasets. The 78-pft datasets were
developed for use with prognostic crops originally. The current changes
allow the model to use the 78-pft datasets in 16-pft runs by
collapsing the crop pfts (cfts) from specific types to the model's
generic crop types. The changes are generic so that the model may still
read 16-pft datasets for 16-pft runs. Ultimately these changes will
permit users to run with any number of pfts, while the ctsm group
maintains a single set of input pft data.

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values):
- maxpatch_pft made obsolete
- nnegcrit was increased because of failure in the TRENDY simulations.
This was done in the source, rather than the namelist but does have an
effect on user behavior.

Substantial timing or memory changes: No

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in ../CTSMMasterChecklist as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

   The "irrigate" attribute should now be removed from all fsurdat files for namelist generation.
   Thus irrigate on or off is now an option for non-crop cases.


Renamed parameters:
maxpatch_pft is obsolete; remove from namelist-related scripts in future PR
numpft + 1 ---> maxsoil_patches
maxpatch_pft ---> maxsoil_patches in CNDV
numpft ---> maxveg
numpft_ed ---> maxveg_fates

Several modules were made default private. The list of variables in them

One-line Summary: CMIP6 compset modifiers, usermods for typical output, and other output enhancements

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Support %BGC-CROP-CMIP6DECK and %BGC-CROP-CMIP6WACCMDECK compset
    modifiers, so that we can turn on the necessary options
    (output-related and others) via new CMIP6-specific compsets.

(2) Turn on carbon isotopes in CMIP6 runs (from Erik Kluzek)

(3) Remove setting of CCSM_BGC=CO2A in the cmip6 usermods

(4) Add usermods directories for getting typical extra output that's
    wanted in many cases: output_crop, output_crop_highfreq, output_bgc,
    output_bgc_highfreq, output_sp, and output_sp_highfreq. These can be
    enabled by adding something like '--user-mods-dir output_crop' on
    the create_newcase line (that short-hand works for an I compset; for
    F or B compsets, you need to provide the full path to the usermod
    directory).

(4) Allow holes in the number of history tapes. Holes are cases where,
    for example, we have h0, h1 and h3 tapes, but no h2 tape (because
    there are no fields on the h2 tape). (This is needed for (3).)

(5) Fix reading and writing of 1-d logical global arrays. This fixes
    ESCOMP/ctsm#24 for real (rather than just preventing an attempt to
    read/write 1-d logical arrays, as was done in the previous 'fix').

(6) Add C13_NBP and C14_NBP diagnostic fields (from Keith Oleson)

(7) Make a bunch of carbon isotope diagnostic fields inactive by default

(8) Don't allow interpolation (use_init_interp) from a case without
    carbon isotopes to a case with carbon isotopes: Due to
    https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/67, interpolation from a case
    without carbon isotopes to a case with carbon isotopes yields
    incorrect initialization values for the carbon isotopes. Now that
    we're turning carbon isotopes on via some semi-out-of-the-box
    usermods (for cmip6), it is becoming more important to check to make
    sure someone doesn't shoot themselves in the foot this way.

(9) Add tests of the new output usermods as well as of the CMIP6 compset
    modifiers

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Fixes #24 for real (ncd_io_1d_log_glob is broken)
- Fixes #529 (Organize usermods_dirs to facilitate running cases with
  the right output)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variable, just for testing purposes:
  for_testing_allow_interp_non_ciso_to_ciso. This bypasses an error
  check, and should only be used in tests.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:
- Reworked tests of cmip6_deck usermods to use the new
  %BGC-CROP-CMIP6DECK compset modifier, and changed f09_g16 to f09_g17
- Added a test of the %BGC-CROP-CMIP6WACCMDECK compset modifier
- Added tests of output_crop_highfreq, output_bgc_highfreq and
  output_sp_highfreq usermods directories
- Note that there are NO tests covering the cmip6_evolving_icesheet
  usermods: this usermod directory adds very little beyond cmip6_deck,
  so it didn't seem worth its own test

    cheyenne_gnu ------ ok
    hobart_nag -------- ok
    hobart_pgi -------- ok
    hobart_intel ------ ok

    ok means tests and baseline comparisons pass. There were unexpected
    NLCOMP diffs. From spot-checking a few tests, I see the following:

    
    (1) On both cheyenne and hobart: Diffs in logfile. This looks like a
        problem in cime: it says:

        BASE: logfile = 'rof.log.136342.hobart.cgd.ucar.edu
        COMP: logfile = 'rof.log

    (2) On hobart: Diffs in pio_typename: netcdf vs. pnetcdf (says that
        new uses pnetcdf): but when I compare files by hand, they look
        the same in this respect (both baseline and new use netcdf), so
        maybe this is due to a problem in the timing of when nlcomp is
        run?

    Since these both look like problems in the comparison script rather
    than in the tag, I'm letting these go, but will open a cime issue if
    we see this again.

One-line Summary: Fix the fact that transient Bgc and SP cases had constant crop area in time

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fix transient non-crop cases that had constant crop area so that crop area will change in time
(and hence natural veg area will also change corresponding to it).

Also bring in changes to update mksurfdata_map to handle SSP-RCP future scenarios. Right now
it can handle SSP5-8.5 out of the box. Also add a new test for that.

One-line Summary: Add snow-free fields for snowmip, fix several issues

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bring in new diagnostic fields added by Justin Perket, Sean Swenson and Mark Flanner
for Snow-MIP. Most of those are fields that represent "Snow Free" data.

Also bring in fixes for a list of issues. Add handling of the new CO2 which includes
both latitude-band and global average versions. Add some changes to make it easier
for input data processing including NOT doing the slow 1km map file creation. Have
the number of steps that are skipped at startup dependent on the time-step size. Add
a test for some requirements of WACCMX (time-step and use of ESMF). Calculations of 
local time are now done in a global subroutine, that can handle negative longitudes.
Fix how FFIX_TO_SMINN is handled for history output. The namelist logical "calc_human_stress_indices"
changed from logical to a character string of three values: FAST, NONE, ALL. FAST
is the default so the less expensive ones are output, NONE turns them all off, and ]
ALL does all of them including the expensive ones.

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   I was able to reduce the duplication in SurfaceAlbedoMod where the original implementation added a cut
   and paste copy of code. But, there is still a lot of duplication in this file that could be improved, by
   making smaller functions/subroutines to do sections of code that are essentially repeated many times.
   There's a bit of an increase in complexity to reduce the duplication, but reducing the duplication was worth it.

Changes to tests or testing:
   Add a new waccmx_offline test mods and test with it
   New test expected fail because of cime issue: ERS_D_Ln9_P480x3.f19_g16.I2000Clm50SpGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-waccmx_offline
   Turn use_ssre on for most tests, off for reducedOutput
   And set calc_human_stress_indices=NONE for reducedOutput, FAST for most, and ALL for KitchenSink and KSMOut tests

One-line Summary: Add water tracer consistency checks, and other water tracer work

Purpose of changes
------------------

1. Add water tracer consistency checks

2. Add infrastructure for looping over all water tracers - currently
   just used for the tracer consistency checks

3. Breakout of atm2lnd and lnd2atm water variables, needed for water tracers

4. Add some namelist control over the addition of water tracers

5. Add a system test that exercises the water tracer consistency checks

6. Add a 'ratio' variable for each water tracer

7. Add some unit tests of the new water tracer infrastructure

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Don't be fooled by the new namelist variable, enable_water_isotopes:
  This is just a place-holder for now, not implying that water isotopes
  are actually working.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variables: enable_water_tracer_consistency_checks and
  enable_water_isotopes. The latter is just a place-holder for now.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)

    not match the glacier area from CISM.)

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: ctsm1.0.dev006


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Startup / Hybrid runs that include CISM
     (even NOEVOLVE) and do not use init_interp, due to:
     - different PE layout in new case vs. the one that generated the
       finidat (roundoff-level diffs)
     - different glacier area on finidat file vs. what's in CISM
       (greater than roundoff-level diffs)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Roundoff-level for different PE layout, larger than roundoff but
      should be same climate when there is different glacier area on the
      finidat file vs. what's in CISM

      The differences arise from dynamic landunit adjustments of the
      below-ground C and N states in the old code, as CTSM adjusts its
      areas to match CISM's. In the new code, there are no C and N
      adjustments in the first time step from this adjustment.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Rework water data types to accommodate isotopes and other tracers

Purpose of changes
------------------

This tag reworks the various water data types to allow having multiple
instances of variables that are needed for isotopes and other water
tracers.

Specific changes include:

(1) Separated "water state" variables into state, diagnostic and balance
    check-related variables. This separation was not essential for the
    work here, but was desired by Martyn Clark and others.

(2) For each of water state, diagnostic and flux variables, separated
    variables into those needed for both bulk and tracers vs. those only
    needed for bulk. This way, we can have multiple instances of the
    variables needed by tracers, but only a single instance of variables
    that only apply to bulk water. This follows the design laid out in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395. The separation was based
    largely on what was done in the old water isotope branch; we didn't
    put a lot of thought into this, because the new design allows us to
    easily migrate variables between bulk-only and bulk-and-tracer as
    needed.

(3) Moved water fluxes that were defined in science modules back into
    waterflux_type or waterfluxbulk_type. This was needed for (2); there
    is more discussion on this in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395 and the log message for
    commit 711e5cd7.

(4) Introduced a top-level water_type that holds instances of all of the
    other water-related objects. This follows the design laid out in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395. This is particularly
    valuable for the tracer instances: the logic related to number of
    tracers can be encapsulated in water_type, rather than infiltrating
    clm_instMod.

(5) Added placeholders for water tracer instances

(6) Added infrastructure to generate history / restart field names for
    the tracer instances. Eventually, the isotope class can also hold
    information specific to each isotope.

This work was a joint effort between Mathew Rothstein and myself; Mat
gets much of the credit for the actual refactoring done here.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Fixes #358 (Separate WaterStateType into multiple types)
- Fixes #434 (Separate WaterFluxType into a base class and a class that just applies to bulk)
- Fixes #359 (Set up infrastructure for multiple instances of WaterState and WaterFlux types)
- Fixes #458 (Implement handling of history and restart variables for water tracers)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
- #464 (Some lines longer than 132 characters)
- #456 (Remove backwards compatibility check for snw_rds) (not a
  newly-introduced issue, but it's more important to fix this with the
  separation of waterstate_type)

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Water tracers are not yet functional - they are just placeholders
- Whether to use water tracers and which water tracers to use are
  currently hard-coded; eventually, this should be namelist-controlled

Changes to tests or testing: none

Code reviewed by: Mathew Rothstein and Bill Sacks worked together on
these changes and reviewed each other's changes to some extent. The
high-level design was also reviewed and co-developed by Mariana
Vertenstein. Martyn Clark contributed substantially to the breakout of
water state into state, diagnostic and balance check-related variables.

One-line Summary: Fix NFIX flux variables so special land-units are zeroed out, tools update, add some *_MAX fields on mksurfdata_map for transient cases

Purpose of changes
------------------

Nitrogen Fixation flux arrays were being set to missing value over non-vegetated landunits. This sets them to zero everywhere
and averages in the zero's at the gridcell level for history output. It also reads in restarts with missing values and converts
them to zero's.

There are also some tools updates, getting the tools working on the new upgraded hobart.cgd.ucar.edu.

And mksurfdata_map is updated to add some *_MAX files on the landuse.timeseries files that will allow us to conserve memory
for transient cases.

One-line Summary: Begin separating SoilHydrology flux calculations

Note the new tag naming: Starting with this tag, we are naming tags
"ctsm..." rather than "clm...". We are starting with ctsm version 1,
which for now is nearly the same as clm version 5. We are moving to this
new tag naming now because:

(1) The changes in this tag represent the first step towards
    implementing the CTSM vision (separating the biogeophysics flux
    calculations from state updates, making it easier to plug in
    alternative parameterizations, etc.).

(2) This tag changes answers relative to the CLM5 release. (We expect
    the climate to be the same, but we haven't tested this carefully
    yet.)

Purpose of changes
------------------

First steps toward separating various flux calculations in the soil
hydrology code. The focus here is on saturated surface runoff and
infiltration excess runoff. The changes here separate flux calculations
from state updates and extract various calculations into their own
subroutines to facilitate swapping in alternative parameterizations.

Most of the changes here are refactorings that are either bit-for-bit or
just introduce roundoff-level differences. However, there are also a few
larger answer changes, as described below.

These are the greater-than-roundoff-level answer changes:

(A1) Use full qflx_surf in BGC code. Previously, the subroutines ch4 and
     SoilBiogeochemNLeaching had been using a flux that excluded surface
     water runoff (qflx_h2osfc_surf). That was deemed to be incorrect
     (by Dave Lawrence and others), so these BGC subroutines have been
     changed to use the full surface runoff (saturated excess runoff +
     infiltration excess runoff + h2osfc runoff).

     Configurations affected: BGC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; expected to be same
     climate, but not investigated carefully

(A2) VIC: Don't ever use the TOPModel formulation for SurfaceRunoff

     The code was using the TOPModel-based formulation for SurfaceRunoff
     if frost_table > zwt_perched. Sean Swenson felt this shouldn't be
     done, and refactoring will be easier if VIC always uses the
     vic-looking formulation, so I'm stopping applying this formulation
     when using VIC.

     Configurations affected: VIC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; not investigated carefully

(A3) VIC: Remove infiltration excess runoff

     Martyn Clark reviewed the VIC implementation, and felt that the
     current implementation of infiltration excess runoff is
     inconsistent with the standard VIC implementation. It appears that
     what was being called VIC's infiltration excess runoff was actually
     just an attempt to give a better numerical approximation to the
     solution for saturated surface excess runoff. So deleting this
     leaves only a first-order approximation to VIC's saturated surface
     excess runoff.

     Eventually we may want to put in place a more accurate solution for
     VIC's saturated surface excess runoff. But Martyn's feeling is that
     this can come in with other changes we want to make regarding
     numerical solutions in CTSM.

     Configurations affected: VIC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; expected to be same
     climate, but not investigated carefully

(A4) Change in QOVER diagnostic field: now includes QH2OSFC.

These are the major refactorings (either bit-for-bit or just
roundoff-level differences):

(R1) Extract surface runoff to its own module, and other modularization
     related to what used to be subroutine SurfaceRunoff: extract a
     subroutine for each fsat method, move urban surface runoff code
     into different routines.

(R2) Extract infiltration excess runoff to its own module, and other
     modularization related to what used to be subroutine Infiltration.

NOTE: For a detailed breakdown of changes, including documentation of
which changed changed answers, see the file ChangeLog_branch which was
deleted from this branch shortly before it was merged to master.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Shortened a 25-month f19 test to 13-months
  (SMS_Lm13.f19_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput):
  This test took a long time to run, and we already have long tests of
  this configuration at coarse-resolution. I suggested removing this
  test entirely, but Erik Kluzek wanted to maintain a shortened version
  of it. Erik's comments were:

     How about either flip it to f45 (because Rosie is using that
     resolution for science) -- or leave it at f19 and have it run for 9
     months? The 25 months was to take it just past the 2-year spinup
     time. From spunup initial conditions 9-months pretty much does a
     full harvest cycle. f19 and f09 are the main configurations for
     science and it would be good to have something longer than just
     really short tests.

  I decided on Lm13, because this still completes in significantly less
  than 2-hours, and if we're running for 9 months anyway, it seems
  valuable to finish out the year and run a bit into the next year,
  since some crop stuff triggers at the end of the year.

Code reviewed by: Various code reviews done last Fall, when these
changes were first implemented.
