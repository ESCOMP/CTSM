One-line Summary: Improve robustness of onset and offset counters when changing dt

Purpose of changes
------------------

The logic in CNPhenology for onset_counter and offset_counter was not
robust when the model time step differed from the time step used to
generate the finidat file. This showed up when running with a 20-minute
time step using a finidat file that was generated with a 30-minute time
step. See https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1163 for details.

The fix here improves the situation significantly, but I believe still
leaves some issues remaining; see
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1167 for details.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1163 (onset_counter variable on (all?) restart
  files is not compatible with subsequent model runs using a 20 minute
  time step)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
- ESCOMP/CTSM#1167 (Rework CNPhenology onset and offset triggers to be
  more robust to changes in dt)
  - This issue was not exactly introduced in this tag, but it captures
    some things that I think still need to be done for complete robustness

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES, but in very limited circumstances

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Only when the model run uses a different
      time step than the initial conditions file
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      larger than roundoff; magnitude not investigated; in some cases,
      the differences might be significant if the model actually
      continues without aborting

    In the aux_clm test suite, this only appears in one test:
      SMS_Ln9.ne30pg2_ne30pg2_mg17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-clm50cam6LndTuningMode

    but it might appear more widely in cam / fully coupled testing

One-line Summary: Add capability for dynamic lakes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Adds the capability for dynamic lake areas, read from the
landuse_timeseries file. This represents reservoir construction. For
now, this capability is off by default. Turning it on requires new
fields on the landuse_timeseries file which cannot yet be produced by
mksurfdata_map; these new fields will be added in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073.

A substantial part of this tag involved changing the accounting of water
and energy in lakes in order to conserve water and energy across
landunit transitions while not producing too large adjustment
fluxes. This change results in roundoff-level answer changes for all
transient cases.

The core changes in this tag are from Inne Vanderkelen, in consultation
with Bill Sacks. Additional changes are from Bill Sacks, in consultation
with Inne Vanderkelen.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#200 (Count energy of water in lakes in total
  gridcell heat content)
- Resolves ESCOMP/CTSM#1140 (Add lake water to dynbal baselines)

Significant changes to scientifically-supported configurations

[ ] clm4_5

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Using the dynamic lakes functionality will require either the
  mksurfdata_map changes in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073 or
  manually adding the necessary fields to the landuse_timeseries file.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variable for transient runs: do_transient_lakes

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in README.CHECKLIST.master_tags as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Using the dynamic lakes functionality will require either the
  mksurfdata_map changes in https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/1073 or
  manually adding the necessary fields to the landuse_timeseries file.
- For this reason, the new test
  (ERS_Lm25.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHistClm50BgcCropQianRsGs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly)
  requires a manual step to create the necessary landuse_timeseries
  file. This step is documented in the README file for the
  clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly testmod.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a single-point test covering dynamic lakes, using a
  manually-created landuse_timeseries file:
  ERS_Lm25.1x1_smallvilleIA.IHistClm50BgcCropQianRsGs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-smallville_dynlakes_monthly

CTSM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - ok

    Tests pass, differences from baseline as expected due to new
    namelist variable

  tools-tests (test/tools):

    cheyenne - not run

  PTCLM testing (tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

    cheyenne - not run

  python testing (see instructions in python/README.md; document testing done):

    (any machine) - not run

  regular tests (aux_clm):

    cheyenne ---- ok
    izumi ------- ok

    Tests pass, baselines differ as expected

If the tag used for baseline comparisons was NOT the previous tag, note that here:


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):
  And always remove these three lines and parts that don't apply.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Transient cases
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Mostly roundoff-level. See below for details.

      - Differences in HEAT_CONTENT1, ICE_CONTENT1, LIQUID_CONTENT1, as
        expected

      - In transient tests (including Hist/SSP, Fates, CNDV and
        transient glacier), roundoff-level diffs in EFLX_DYNBAL,
        QFLX_ICE_DYNBAL and QFLX_LIQ_DYNBAL, along with related flux
        terms, and river volume

      - In some transient tests, roundoff-level diffs in methane terms,
        presumably from downstream effects of changes in VOLR due to
        roundoff-level changes in fluxes. In multi-year tests, these
        methane diffs grow to bigger than roundoff-level, but I think
        they originate from roundoff-level diffs. (I feel like I've seen
        this high sensitivity before.)

      - glcMEC_increase test
        (ERP_P180x2_D_Ld5.f19_g17_gl4.I1850Clm50BgcCropG.cheyenne_intel.clm-glcMEC_increase)
        shows significant differences in river-related terms, maybe due
        to glacier running over lake and now lake has different states
        than before; also, FILLDIFFs in h1 file because lake remains
        active even when it goes to 0 area.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?
   - Examined cprnc RMS diffs

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Reduce duplication between caps

Purpose of changes
------------------

 Eliminate duplication of the "derived quantities for required fields"
 and corresponding error checking codes that repeat across the mct,
 nuopc, and lilac caps. This consolidates the code and reduces
 maintenance requirements.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change: Larger than roundoff/same climate


Detailed list of changes
------------------------

 Changes were implemented in three steps:

 1) Bit-for-bit: @billsacks simplified subroutine QSat by making three
 arguments optional (es, qsdT, esdT).

 2) Answer-changing: @slevisconsulting replaced local calculations of
 qsat in /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc with calls to
 CTSM's subroutine QSat. Subroutine QSat uses a higher-order polynomial
 approximation to estimate qsat, which explains the larger than
 round-off diffs. When moving the three identical local approximations
 to QSat as a temporary test instead of using the higher-order
 polynomial approximation, the diffs reduce to round-off.

 3) Bit-for-bit: @slevisconsulting consolidated repeating codes in
 /src/cpl/mct, /src/cpl/lilac, and /src/cpl/nuopc by placing in the new
 file /src/utils/lnd_import_export_utils.F90.

One-line Summary: Start the clm5_1 physics series, with some changes to the fire model from Fang Li

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fang Li's latest Fire version - includes allowing clm5.1 phys version. New physics option is added
called "clm5_1", with currently the new feature to use the latest fire changes. This has some
adjustments to the fire model and includes some changes to the parameter file. Other new features
will be added into clm5_1 in future tags.

Also bring in mksurfdata changes for the raw urban dataset change. This adds some changes to
mksurfdata for a new urban raw dataset, as well as preparation for new changes for some other
urban changes that will be a future part of clm5_1. Also use the half degree lightning dataset
by default for clm5_1.

Start adding a new test list ctsm_sci that tests all the scientifically supported compsets.
Some of those tests fail due to existing issues, that will be fixed later.

Some more work done to change clm to ctsm, and allow for ctsm as a component.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): 
  Fix #1142 -- Add ctsm_sci test list
  Fix #1145 -- File was corrupted on glade
  Fix #1144 -- Move btran2 to just inside of fire model
  Fix #889 --- Some adjustments to the Li Fire model
