- get seqclm updates from mv
- rename hist interfaces to hist_*
- remove typexy, nlonxy,nlatxy from history field_info type,
  now use the type1d and type1d_out strings to
  trigger the input/output "type" and behavior.
  fix code so it works properly using type1d*.
  typexy was already not used.  calls to history
  routines had to change in several modules.
- clean up hist file write statements, add subname consistently
- modify calls to histFile for change to nlonxy,nlatxy,type1d*
- use clmtypes namep, grlnd, etc instead of 'pft','gridcell',etc.

Summary of testing:

One-line Summary: put in hourly coupling with sequential driver

Purpose of changes: To only communicate with sequential driver on
CAM shortwave time step. Also added the functionality to run in
an "I" configuration through the sequential driver (dtam7, stub-ice,
stub-ocn, clm). This will become the default way in the near future.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): None

Describe any changes made to build system: 
   M  configure
      - added option to run through sequential system - now
        can invoke configure with either -con_ccsm or -seq_ccsm
        as inputs (rather than just -ccsm)
   A  run-pc-seq.csh
      - script to run with datm7 (this will eventually need to be
        migrated into a clm build-namelist functionality)
   A  run-ibm-seq.csh
      - script to run with datm7 (this will eventually need to be
        migrated into a clm build-namelist functionality)

Describe any changes made to the namelist: None 
None for the default offine mode. The datm7-clm mode, however,
will require new namelist settings for the sequential driver and
datm7.  

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: None

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: None

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:
   M  src/main/abortutils.F90
      - removed following cpp #if-def
        #if (defined OFFLINE) || (defined COUP_CSM) || (defined SEQ_ESMF) || (defined SEQ_MCT)
   M  src/main/clm_comp.F90
      - clm_run1 - removed optional arguments for nextsw_cday and dosend (these calculations 
	now occur in lnd_comp_mct.F90
      - clm_run2 - added optional arguments nlend and rdate that are now obtained from SyncClock
        to determine name stamp on restart file and flag if run is ending on this time step
      - removed various timing library start/stop calls that are now in lnd_comp_mct.F90
   M  src/main/driver.F90
      - added optional arguments nlend and rdate to driver2 (that are passed from clm_run2 - see above)
   M  src/main/fileutils.F90
      - removed old comments
   M  src/main/histFileMod.F90
      - added optional arguments nlend and rstwr that are passed down from driver2 that will only be
        invoked in sequential driver mode
   M  src/main/clm_csmMod.F90
      - formatting 
   M  src/main/restFileMod.F90
      - added nlend as optional argument to restFile_write and restFile_write_binary
      - added rdate as optional argument to restFile_filename 
      - modified logic for nlend in restFile_archive for (defined SEQ_MCT) || (defined SEQ_ESMF)
        these last modifications will become irrelevant when long term archiver gets implemented in 
        offline clm
   M  src/main/controlMod.F90
      - moved offline_atmdir to its own separate #ifdef
        #if (defined OFFLINE)
            namelist /clm_inparm/ offline_atmdir
        #endif
   M  src/main/lnd_comp_mct.F90
       - made numerous changes to only couple to sequential driver on atmosphere short wave timesteps
         the calendar used for the next radiation computation is determined via the following:
             call eshr_timemgr_clockGet( SyncClock, nextsw_cday=nextsw_cday )
       - all fluxes are averaged between dosend=.true. times 
       - the time stamp of the restart file is determined from the sync clock
       - the coordination with the sync clock is now determined at the end of the time loop due
         to the fact that the sync clock is advanced at the beginning of the driver time loop 
   M  src/main/do_close_dispose.F90
       - numerous changes were made to this file 
         added optional arguments rstwr and nlend and generalized code to respond to these arguments

Summary of testing:
   - Note that CLM_SEQCCSMROOT was set to a checked out version of the cam branch 
     https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/cam1/branch_tags/seqflxave_cam3_4_01/seqflxave16_cam3_4_12
   - The folloiwng files were modified to fix a SCAM problem account for the fact that the driver time step is now
     one hour:

Tag name:  clm3_5_00
Originator(s):  erik (Erik Kluzek)
Date: Thu May  3 12:03:53 MDT 2007
Date:One-line Summary: New surface datasets, improved canopy integration, and various improvements to Hydrology

Purpose of changes (Since CLM3.0):

  CLM3.5 is considerably different to CLM3.0, particularly with respect to its 
  simulation of the hydrologic cycle.   The modifications consist of new surface 
  datasets based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products 
  (Lawrence and Chase 2007), an improved canopy integration scheme 
  (Thornton and Zimmermann 2007), scaling of canopy interception (Lawrence et al. 2007), 
  a simple TOPMODEL-based model for surface and sub-surface runoff (Niu et al. 2005), a 
  simple groundwater model for determining water table depth (Niu et al. 2007), and a 
  new frozen soil scheme (Niu and Yang 2006).  

  There are four additional modifications.  Three of these, an improved description of 
  soil water availability, a resistance term to reduce excessive soil evaporation, and the
  introduction of a factor to simulate nitrogen limitation on plant productivity, can be 
  categorized as new or improved parameterizations from the perspective of CLM3.  The 
  other may be categorized as fixing an algorithmically defective existing parameterization
  (correction to snowage calculation so that snowage increases monotonically) 
  (Dickinson et al. 2006).

  See:

  http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/clm/distribution/clm3.5/

  for more information, and for technical and scientific papers that describe CLM3.5.

  Lastly, we are distributing a new forcing dataset with the new code.  This
  dataset was derived by combining observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation and
  surface air temperature with intramonthly variations from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 
  (Qian et al., 2006)

  If you would like to run CLM-CN, please contact Peter Thornton (thornton@ucar.edu).
  If you would like to run CLM-DGVM, please contact Sam Levis (slevis@ucar.edu).
  If you would like to run CLM-CASA', please contact Forrest Hoffman (hof@ornl.gov).

Describe any bug fixes:

  o A revision of RTM-subcycling and corrections to a few land-locked grid cells.
  o A more efficient soil evaporation calculation based on PFT demand.
  o A fix to aggregation of LAI from high-resolution source data to CLM surface data.
  o Changing Temperature of freezing of water from 273.16 (triple point of water) to 273.15.

Summarize any software engineering improvements:

  o Add option to run CLM at a finer resolution than the atmospheric model coupled to
     (Tony Craig and others)
  o MCT (Model Coupling Toolkit) used to describe decompositions and do redistributions.
  o Remove dependences on CAM modules and data structures.
  o Use csm_share clocks and CCSMInit objects for simulation time information and
    initialization information needed by all CCSM models.
  o Update time-management to ESMF_2_2_2r interfaces and use the WRF implementation of
    ESMF time-management modules.
  o Made restart datasets double precision NetCDF rather than binary 
    (except history restarts).
  o Add interface layers to link to Sequential CCSM (formally standalone CAM) using MCT.
  o Parallelize RTM, by Tony Craig and Pat Worley.
  o Add a new testing suite to do automated testing for any code changes.
  o Improve memory scaling with a new decomposition from Tony Craig.
  o Move make surface dataset capability to an offline tool (mksurfdata).
  o Add an offline tool to create grid datasets needed for initialization (mkgriddata).
  o Add ability to run concurrent CCSM in single-executable mode.
  o Running with SCAM (Single Column Atmospheric Model) mode modularized better.

Versions of any externally defined libraries: (under src/utils)

  o csm_share:        share3_070321 (add flds, eshr and dshr directories, 
                                     add shr_inputinfo_mod, eshr_timemgr_mod, 
                                     other modules for shared data work)
  o esmf_wrf_timemgr: esmf_wrf_timemgr_060616 (or can link to full ESMF_2_2_2r)
  o timing:           timing_070328 (extensive updates and utilize PAPI and new namelist)
  o mct:              MCT2_3_0_070206 (allow to build with code, Cray mods, misc.)

Describe any changes made to build system: 

  o A configure script was created to create files needed to build the model. 
  o There are also cshell run scripts for different platforms to: 
       configure, build and run the model.
  o Remove SPMD CPP token -- use src/utils/mct/mpi-serial library for serial mode.
  o Remove HIDE_MPI token.
  o Remove CAM and COUP_CAM CPP tokens -- replace with SEQ_MCT and SEQ_ESMF.
  o Remove NOCOMPETE CPP token.
  o Most SCAM #ifdef's removed.
  o Remove TIMING_BARRIERS CPP token -- add option to prof_inparm namelist.
  o See src/utils/timing for new tokens added for timing library 
     (HAVE_PAPI, THREADED_OMP, DIAG, HASH).
  o MCT included with offline CLM.

  Build features added -- but unsupported for public release:

  o Port to jaguar.ccs.ornl.gov (Cray XT3/XT4)
  o Port to Bluegene/L (frost.ucar.edu) (add BGL CPP token)
  o Port to lightning.ucar.edu (frost.ucar.edu with Pathscale)
  o Add SINGLE_EXEC CPP token for running concurrent CCSM in single-executable mode.
  o Add CN CPP token and CN BGC code.
  o Add NO_FIRE CPP token for use by CN mode.
  o Add AD_SPINUP and EXIT_SPINUP CPP token for initial spinup of CN.
  o Add DUST and PROGSST CPP tokens.
  o Add COUP_WRF CPP token.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

  Main namelist name changed from clmexp to clm_inparm

  Option to run clm at a finer mesh than the atmosphere added several namelist items.

  flndtopo        = 256 character land topography file name
  fatmgrid        = 256 character atmosphere grid data file name
  fatmlndfrc      = 256 character landfrac (on atm grid) file name
  fatmtopo        = 256 character atmosphere topography file name

  Decomposition/performance control:

  nsegspc         = Number of segments per clump for new decomp. 
                    1 will produce poor loadbalance, infinity yields too many
                    segments per pe but good load balance. (default 20)

  All mksrf_* options moved to the mksurfdata offline tool. So instead of
  creating surface datasets by running clm -- you run the mksurfdata tool
  to create them.

  mksrf_* = Removed from namelist.

  Miscellaneous:

  rest_flag            = logical, turns restart file writing on (default .true.)
  wrtdia               = true if want output written  (default .false.)
  create_crop_landunit = true => separate crop landunit is not created by default
                         (currently broken see KnownBugs) (default .false.)

  New prof_inparm namelist added for timing library.

   profile_single_file  = Write timing output to single file or file per task 
                          (default single)
   profile_disable      = Turn timing off. (default .false.)
   profile_barrier      = Turn MPI barriers on in t_barrierf calls. (default .false.)
   profile_depth_limit  = Integer indicating maximum number of levels of timer nesting 
                          (default 99999)
   profile_detail_limit = integer indicating maximum detail level to profile (default 0)
   profile_timer        = integer indicating which timer to use
      GPTLwall           = 1
      GPTLcpu            = 2
      GPTLabort_on_error = 3
      GPTLoverhead       = 4
      GPTLdepthlimit     = 5
      GPTLgettimeofday   = 6
      GPTLnanotime       = 7
      GPTLrtc            = 8
      GPTLmpiwtime       = 9
      GPTLclockgettime   = 10
      GPTLpapitime       = 11
      (default is 9, except on UNICOSMP where it is 8)

  Namelist items added -- but unsupported in public release:

  co2_type             = values of 'prognostic','diagnostic','constant' 
                         (only constant mode for OFFLINE)

  CASA':

  spunup   =  0=no, 1=yes (used with nsrest/=1 only)   (default 0)
  lalloc   =  0=fixed allocation, 1=dynamic allocation (default 1)
  lnpp     =  1=gpp*gppfact,2=fn(lgrow)*gppfact        (default 2)
  q10      =  temperature dependence                   (default 2.0)
  fcpool   =  Carbon Pool initial state filename

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

 Use following files for T42 resolution:

 finidat        = '$CSMDATA/inidata_3.1/offline/clmi_0000-01-01_064x128_c070403.nc'
 fsurdat        = '$CSMDATA/surfdata/$fsurdat'

 frivinp_rtm    = '$CSMDATA/rtmdata/rdirc.05.061026'

 Only needed for CN mode:

- rename lvegxy,lwtxy to vegxy, wtxy
- implement general setgatm, get finemesh working again
- refactor pftdynMod for low memory implementation, validate pfydyn mode
- modify ndep and pftdyn from x = x1*wt1 + x2*wt2 to x = x2 + wt1*(x1-x2)
  as suggested by k.lindsay, improves roundoff performance
- clean up some old code
- add new tests configurations (10x15_pftdyn, t31_dgvm_long, t42half), 
- update pretag lists, add new tests

One-line Summary: merge fmf branch to trunk (low memory mods)

Purpose of changes: reduce memory and improve memory scaling

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system: began adding support
  for frost in Makefile and added a run-frost.csh (not yet
  fully validated)

Describe any changes made to the namelist: added new optional namelist
  input, nsegspc (number of segments per clump for new decomp.  default
  is 20, 1 will produce poor loadbalance, infinity yields too many
  segments per pe but good load balance.  performance asymptotes for
  several configurations at about 5-10 segments/pe, use 20 as default.)

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: NONE

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: significant reduction
  in memory use and improved memory scaling.

Code reviewed by:

List any svn externals directories updated (csm_share, mct, etc.): update
  to mct external, MCT2_3_0_070206

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

- implement new 1d decomp based on ngsegspc rather than balancing pfts,
  ngsegspc is the number of segments per clump.  the 1d gridcells will
  be divided into clumps and segments per clump so there will be
  a total number of segments, clumps*nsegspc, each of about equal number
  of gridcells, that will be distributed round-robin to pes.  pfts are
  derived later and will hopefully end up being nearly as well load
  balanced as the previous method without having to precompute pfts
  and requiring much less memory.  see above for more info on the namelist 
  input and default.
- reorganize initialization, split decomp_init into three phases,
  atm (coarse), lnd (finemesh), and glcp (subgrid).
- add new datatype, latlon to hold some global grid info
- now all domain info is local (although initialization still needs
  to be modified)
- remove some dead code
- add new timers (bug #302)
- split gatm out of domain type
- create simple setgatm_UNITY routine, finemesh capability now disabled,
  must fix setgatm in future version
- move wtxy, vegxy, and pctspec to clm_varsur, allocate as local arrays
  now (begg:endg) and modify surfrd to handle local data only both for
  I/O and initialization.
- implement gather/scatter routines in spmdGathScatMod that use gsmaps.
- update MCT and share
- port to frost
- get rid of some of the global decomps use in code, still more to do
- memory cleanup in STATICEcosysDynMod
- implement new ncdio methods for reading to local gridcell data using gsmaps
- clean up atmdrv, use newer low mem datatypes, reduce memory
- clean up rtm, use newer low mem datatypes, reduce memory
- remove history "lat/lon" fields

One-line Summary:  Minor formatting change in tools.
		   Correctons to ChangLog
		

Purpose of changes: 
1.	Update formatted write in tools/ mkgriddata.F90 and tools/mksrfdat.F90 
	to accomodate 4 digit lat/lons.
2.	Add note to ChangeLog to explain commit by nanr (10/27) that was not tagged.
3.	correct Changelog for tag clm3_expa_80.  The changes listed below never happened.
	surfFileMod.F90 was actually removed from the trunk in a previous tag (clm3_expa_66)
	and renamed surfrdMod.F90.  So this modification probably reflects the status of the branch 
	Keith Oleson was working on.
		M      src/main/surfFileMod.F90

		Removed statements contained within CN ifdef (OK'd by P. Thornton) that:

		! the following test prevents the assignment of temperate deciduous
                  		! vegetation types in the tropics
                  		! 1. broadleaf deciduous temperate tree -> broadleaf deciduous tropical tree
                  		! 2. broadleaf deciduous temperate shrub -> broadleaf deciduous tropical tree
                  		! this reassignment from shrub to tree is necessary because there is currently no
                  		! tropical deciduous broadleaf shrub type defined.

One-line Summary: change in topsoil evaporation.

Purpose of changes:  Change in topsoil evaporation sums the contributions of qflx_evap_soi over
all pft, regardless of sign of the pft

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 264

Describe any changes made to build system: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: Peter Thornton

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

        M      src/biogeophys/Biogeophysics2Mod.F90

1. (around line 297) Changed calculation of topsoil_evap_tot(c) to sum the contributions of qflx_evap_soi(p) over all PFTs, regardle
ss of the sign of the PFT-level flux term.  Previously, this summation was only done over the positive PFT-level evaporation fluxes
(excluded condensation terms).

2. Change (1) eliminates the need for rescaling the topsoil_evap_tot(c) using sumwt(c), so this code was removed (around line 308).
 Calculation of egirat(c) looks the same, but is now based on the modified topsoil_evap_tot(c), which includes both evaporation and
condensation terms.

3. Removed control on positive qflx_evap_soi(p) in block where PFT-level fluxes are being modified to avoid evaporation in excess of
 top-layer water.  Now both evaporation and condensation terms are scaled by egirat(c).

4. Removed calculation of evaprat(p)(around line 323).  Changed calculation of split between soil evaporation and ice sublimation to
 eliminate use of evaprat(p), instead using the ratio of liquid/(liquid+ice) in top layer to partition total evaporation loss into w
ater evaporation and ice sublimation (around line 354).

One-line Summary:  Fix snow age bug.

Purpose of changes: Snow age (which affects snow albedo) is currently reset to zero 
at each time step if there are less than five snow layers.  Snow age should only be 
reset to zero if there are no snow layers.  This fix lowers surface albedo, 
resulting in faster snow ablation in some regions.

	Keith Oleson ran a 20-year global offline simulation and didn't get a single water balance error warning. 
	The annual mean min and max ERRH2O for the new simulation is -3.75e-13 and
	6.7e-14.  Previously it was -4.15e-15 and 1.28e-7.

Hydrology mods: 

M      src/main/clm_varcon.F90

Removed CN ifdef for csoilc.

M      src/main/clmtypeInitMod.F90

Added allocation and initialization for two new pft-physiology variables and
several hydrology variables.

Initialize hkdepth (decay factor).

M      src/main/histFileMod.F90

Changed string from CLM2 to CLM3.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Start Revision:  
   ChangLog modified by nanr (1/11/07):  
   surfFileMod.F90 was removed from the trunk in clm3_expa_66 and renamed surfrdMod.F90.
   Therefore, these changes did not actually happen in the code base.

	M      src/main/surfFileMod.F90

	Removed statements contained within CN ifdef (OK'd by P. Thornton) that:

	! the following test prevents the assignment of temperate deciduous
                 ! vegetation types in the tropics
                 ! 1. broadleaf deciduous temperate tree -> broadleaf deciduous tropical tree
                 ! 2. broadleaf deciduous temperate shrub -> broadleaf deciduous tropical tree
                 ! this reassignment from shrub to tree is necessary because there is currently no
                 ! tropical deciduous broadleaf shrub type defined.

End Revision:   
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One-line Summary: introduced new offline build/run scripts and testing suite

Purpose of changes: New build/run scripts were introduced in order to make it easier 
to run the offline clm on platforms other than the NCAR IBMs. In addition a new testing
suite was introduced that will make it much easier to add new tests and trace the status
of current tests. The new test suite can also be run on a much wider set of platforms
than the NCAR IBMs. Both the new build/run scripts and the new offline test suite were
based on the current CAM build/run scripts and CAM test suite.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): None

Describe any changes made to build system: New build system based on a new "configure" utility

Describe any changes made to the namelist: The namelist generation is the same. For the
the new build/run scripts, sample namelists can be found in the scripts bld/run-*.csh.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: None

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: None

One-line Summary: memory use and rtm parallelization/rewrite

Purpose of changes: Merge fmd07_clm3_expa_75 to the main trunk.
  That branch has several updates related to memory usage and
  parallelization of RTM.  In addition, rtm subcycling was
  added to address problems in cfl in rtm and a bug was fixed
  that resulted in incorrect downstream flux when volumes were
  negative.  Also, mksurfdata was updated to add fmax and
  several other minor bugs were fixed.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
  RTM was changed from velocity limiting to subcycling to
    handle cfl issues.
  RTM bug fix in downstream flux calculation when volumes were
    negative
  Fix to history file for long_name.
  Add bounds attribute to time variable in history files (#254).

- added Pat Worley's mods for initialization performance on phoenix.  in 
  decompMod and areaMod.
- add fmax calculation in mksurdata
- add time bounds attribute and fix long_name string in history files
- rtm refactor.  convert from 2d to 1d fields.  inline routines where
  appropriate.  introduce downstream index instead of rdirc.  
  parallelize over river basins.  update i/o for parallel rtm.
  introduce subcycling.  fix bug in downstream flux calc when
  volume is negative.  introduce max timestep calculation for cfl
  for use in subcyling.  add cfl_scale parameter to rtm to set
  relative cfl limit, set cfl_scale to 0.1.  remove rtmfluxini
  routine, set fluxout=0 at initialization.  update rtm restart
  to maximize backward compatability but allowing upgrade.
- remove global domains after use in initalization.  introduce
  local domains (locdomain) in run phase.  add decomp_domg2l meethod.
  add regional and decomped logicals to domain type.
- migrate all ioglobal calls to iolocal.
- inline interpa2si in atmdrv.
- add mct to externals set, not yet used.

Summary of testing:

  This tag is bfb except when RTM is turned on.  the bug fix
  and subcycling change answers by more than roundoff.  A validation
  was performed with RTM, see below.

  bluesky: clm stand alone tests pass except RTM fields.
  bluesky: cam pretag tests all pass
  tempest: cam pretag tests all pass
  bangkok/lf95: cam pretag tests all pass
  bluevista: ccsm test bfb except rtm fields which lead to
	     divergence in solution after 2 days.  pass ERS test.
  bluevista: finemesh tests case runs to completion.
  lightning: ccsm test bfb except rtm fields which lead to
	     divergence in solution after 2 days.  pass ERS test.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if applicable:
  clm3_expa_69, cam3_3_37, ccsm3_1_beta40

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in:

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: RTM subcyling and bug fix
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): larger than roundoff, same climate

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   b31.001r1 validation run done, see /TCRAIG/csm/b31.001r1 relative
   to /CCSM/csm/b31.001.  Keith Oleson also carried out a standalone
   clm run and found bfb except in runoff fields.  Results reviewed
   by land and ocean groups.

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
   - source tag (all code used must be in the repository): ccsm3_1_beta39

Purpose of changes: Add topographic downscaling, improve memory use and scaling,
	step towards supporting nested grids.  Merge fmc12_clm3_expa_64 to trunk.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: 

Describe any changes made to the namelist: Add two new optional namelist to
	read atm and lnd topography, fatmtop, flndtop

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: Updated the
	mkgriddata tool to produce an optional topographic dataset.
	Several topo datasets added to inputdata/lnd/clm2/griddata/.
	These datasets have not been added to any scripts as they
	are optional at this point and the scripts don't support 
	downscaling yet "out of the box".

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: Memory scaling much improved.
	still too many global arrays in domain and decomp.  these will be removed
	in future revisions.

Merge fmc12_clm3_expa_64 to trunk:
- update mkgrid to add topographic data file generation
- comment out print statement in lnd_comp_mct
- change use of shr_kind_mod in SurfaceAlbedoMod for compiler
  problem on pgi (MVR)
- change clm so memory now dynamically allocated.  LSMLON and LSMLAT
  in preproc.h no longer used except for with SCAM.  MAXPATCH still
  used but could be changed into a namelist input.
- add support for reading topographic datasets and using them
  for downscaling between clm atm and land grids.
- reorganize code to eliminate circular use logic
- rewrite decompInit to improve memory use and scaling
- remove obsolete routines in decompMod.F90
- rename datatype procs to procinfo, now contains only local data
- modify clmtype so all data is local gdc, no more global arrays in
  clmtype!
- update map_type for efficient memory use.  like mct with 1d arrays
  consisting of src, dst, S (COL, ROW, S).  update the internal clm
  atm/lnd mappings to use new datatype.  lnd/rtm and driver/atm
  mapping still using gridmap_type.  this will be updated in future
  versions.
- convert domain from 2d global to 1d global arrays.  add glo 
  decomp which is global 1d indexing like ij to 1d or gsn 
  uncompressed.
- convert wtxy, vegxy, pctspec from 2d to 1d arrays.  migrate many other arrays 
  from 2d global (i,j) to 1d global.  this is for nesting and to eventually
  cut down on number of index mappings in decomp_type
- reorganize order of initialization calls to start thinking about nesting
- add gatm array to domain datatype
- clean up dead code.
- rename initSubgridMod to subgridMod
- move map_indexes to subgridMod, rename get_subgrid_indexees
- rearrange a few subroutines to improve filename hierarchy and use logic
- delete get_sn routines, no longer needed
- update indexing in clm_atmlnd, remove hardwire indexes
- rewrite i/o as needed for 1d global arrays, not 2d
- delete gatherWeightsDGVM from DGVMMod.F90, no longer needed
- rename surfFileMod to surfrdMod.F90
- reduce size of subgrid_type and redefine gcelldc and gcellsn


Summary of testing:

  bluesky: 	clm test passes, cam pretag passes except ccsm
  tempest: 	cam pretag passes
  bangkok/lf95: cam pretag passes except bl153, bl353, bl553 due to code
	changes and resulting binary produced by compiler optimizations.

Added this log entry.

clm_varcon.F90:
Changed co2_ppmv_const to 283.1878_r8 for both CASA' and CN in preparation
for Experiment 1 of the C-LAMP.

histFldsMod.F90
Moved LAISUN, LAISHA, TLAI, TSAI, SLASUN, and SLASHA out of the CN-only
section of the code so that they appear on the regular CLM output files
since the two-leaf radiation code is now standard.  In addition, TLAI and
TSAI were removed from the DGVM-only section of the code since these
output fields are now standard.

   jobscript.csh - Modified for Cray X1E and cross-compiler
   inicFileMod.F90 - Added compiler directives for vectorization
   driver.F90 - Commented out CSDs to avoid model hangs caused by write
      statements in science routines within the associated loops
   controlMod.F90 - Changed default clump_pproc to 1 for the Cray (since CSDs
      are not used in driver.F90
   histFldsMod.F90 - Changed type2d='levlak' for the TLAKE field
   CanopyFluxesMod.F90 - Inserted code to check if the forcing height
      is below the canopy height for any pft.  Model will now abort when this
      occurs instead of taking the log() of a negative number.  See Bug #36

Purpose of changes: Integrate final changes for finemesh implementation.  These
changes are 100% backward compatable and bfb, but also support use of a finemesh grid.  finemesh implementation has been test in clm and cam.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system: Update Makefile so Depends are regenerated if any code is changed.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: Added one new optional namelist, fatmgrid.  This is a dataset for the coarse grid in clm.  The format is the same as the surface dataset but only needs to include grid variables.

One-line Summary: Added bug fix for reading TpoolC in CASA, split long line in DGVM, and modified Makefiles for Cray X1E
Requires change in build system: yes
Modified Makefile for the Cray X1E and the newcprnc build
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM (cheetah)
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store: (For changes that change answers)
Changes made:

1. Fixed TpoolC initialization not to overwrite pools if they were read from
   initial dataset.
2. Split a long line in DGVMEstablishmentMod.F90
3. Updated Makefile for Cray X1E
4. Updated test system for use on Cray X1E and changed netCDF path for ORNL IBM
5. Replaced cprnc.f90 with cprnc.F90 in newcprnc and modified its Makefile to
   use CPP for this file.  NOTE: This was tested only on the IBM and Cray X1E,
   and may require minor Makefile modifications for other platforms.

Ran the following tests on IBM (cheetah):

Changes made:
1) Put in changes to cam_clmMod.F90 to reset the clm grid
to the cam grid. This was done to ensure bfb answers. Given
the number of interface changes that went into clm3_expa_42,
it seemed that isolating the effects of permitting clm to have
a grid that was roundoff level different should be done.
Only a few lines of code need to be changed in order to remove
this restriction. A climate simulation will be done to verify
the effect of permitting grid independence to the roundoff level.
2) Put in fixe to restFileMod.F90 to get cam branch test to
work on tempest.

One-line Summary: put in changes to remove need for autopromotion of floats
Requires change in build system: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: yes
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes made:

1) Nearly every file in CLM was modified in order to 
explicitly type variables and constants in order to 
enable the removal of autopromotion of reals in the Makefile.
Note that this change was already incorporated into the clm
version corresponding to cam3_2_23.

Tom Henderson's tool "addrealkind" was used to change "real"
declarations to "real(r8)" and to add "_r8" to all floating
point constants that were not already typed. These changes
were not incorporated into csm_share or utils/esmf.

2) Updated clm_camMod.F90 so that it was consistent with cam3_2_23.
Put in a tentative change to clm_cam_CheckGrid routine so that
BFB changes with the current version of cam could be produced.
Effectively, the cam grid still overrides the clm grid, even
though the differences in the grids were only on the order of
1.e-13 for latitudes (no differences in longitudes). A climate simulation
will have to be done to verify that making the grids independent does
not change the climate.

Code reviewed by: myself, Tony Craig
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store: (For changes that change answers)
Changes made:
	
1) CLM/CPL6 initialization has been changed so that clm no longer
receives the grid and landfrac/landmask from the coupler, but rather
reads it in from its surface dataset and sends it to the coupler.
The coupler in turn then checks for consistency between the land/atm
grid and the land fractions received.
As part of this, an offline tool has now been constructed by Tony
Craig that will generate the landfrac and grid appropriate for running
on a given ocn/atm resoloution. CLM now no longer will permit fsurdat
to be set to blanks.	
The following files were modified:
    main/clm_csmMod.F90
    main/driver.F90
    main/program_csm.F90
    main/histFileMod.F90	
    biogeochem/DGVMMod.F90	

2) tools/mksurfdata has been modified so that grids can only be
   read in for the purposes of generating surface datasets. A
   new directory - tools/mkgriddata - has been created to enable
   the generation of regular offline clm grids. The functionality
   of grid generation and surface dataset generation has thereby
   been separated. There are complete README files in both directories
   that specify the new namelist settings for generating surface
   datasets and grids.	
	
3) Testing done:
   ran test-model.pl -c clm3_expa_40 and verifed that results were
   bfb in the default non-CN case. Further testing in coupled mode
   will be done by Tony Craig.

Version: CLM3.expa.39
One-line Summary: made restart files netcdf
Requires change in build system: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: yes
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit) 
Changes made:
	
1) Made all restart data netcdf - EXCEPT for history file restarts
   (this still binary - they are used for restart runs only, not for branch runs).
   The effect of this change is that inicFileMod.F90 now only contains code for
   doing perpetual runs in CAM mode.
   Initial files and restart files are still written - but they are the same - 
   ****EXCEPT FOR THE TIME STEP AT WHICH THE ARE OUTPUT***.

   In the current code, the restart file
        casename.clm2.r.1998-01-01-00000.nc
   is written on model date 1998-01-01-00000, whereas the initial file
        casename.clm2.r.1998-01-01-00000.nc 
   is written on model date 1997-12-31-84600 

   There is a fundamental difference between restart runs and initial runs in clm.
   On a restart run (assuming 1800 sec time steps), the restart file 
        casename.clm2.r.1998-01-01-00000.nc
   will be used to determine the time step 
        1998-01-01-01800 
   whereas on an initial run the same restart file (for this tag) will be 
   used to determine the timestep
        1998-01-01-00000
   This is because the restart code increments the time step as part 
   (by calling advance_timestep()) as part of the time manager initialization.
   Note that when running in OFFLINE mode, clm also increments the time step
   for an initial run, so that all initial runs start at time step 1. In 
   CAM and CSM mode, all initial runs start at time step 0. 

   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   THE FOLLOWING THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO NOTE:
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

   o) initsurfalb will be called either when nsrest is 0 if:
      - finidat = ' ' 
      - finidat /= ' ' and albd and albi are not on the initial (or restart) dataset

   o) restart and initial datasets can now be used interchangeably to start up a run
      Assuming you wanted to start up a run at 1998-01-01-00000 from another run
      with case "casename"
      a) Initial runs: finidat should point to 
        - the restart dataset casename.clm2.r.1998-01-01-00000.nc in OFFLINE mode
          (this would have been written out at 1999-01-01-00000)
        - the initial dataset casename.clm2.i.1998-01-01-00000.nc in CAM or CSM mode
          (this would have been written out at 1997-12-31-84600)
      b) Branch runs: nrevsn should point to 
        - the resart filename (CURRENTLY WITHOUT the .nc suffix)
         (this was done to maintain backwards compatibility) 

   o) The current code base is completly backwards compatible with older versions
      of the code in terms of doing intitial runs. It is NOT backwards compatible with restart
      files produced by older versions of the code. 

2) The following routines were changed.

      biogeochem/CNrestMod.F90         (added)
      biogeochem/DGVMMod.F90
      biogeochem/DGVMRestMod.F90

      main/Attic/time_manager.F90
      riverroute/RtmMod.F90
      riverroute/Attic/RunoffMod.F90

3) The automated tests were modified to now run both CASA and DGVM.
   (A new DGVM control run needs to be performed).
   Ran the following tests successfully:

  Offline:
  -------------------
  ./test-model.pl -res T31cnall -c /fis/cgd/cseg/people/mvertens/src/clm/clm3_expa_38
  ./test-model.pl -res T31      -c /fis/cgd/cseg/people/mvertens/src/clm/clm3_expa_38
  ./test-model.pl -res T31cn    -c /fis/cgd/cseg/people/mvertens/src/clm/clm3_expa_38
  ./test-model.pl -res T31casa  -c /fis/cgd/cseg/people/mvertens/src/clm/clm3_expa_38
  ./test-model.pl -res T31dgvm  

  Note that ./test-model.pl -res T31cnall now points to finidat obtained from the CCSM
  BGC case ccsm3_bgc19_F_2: ccsm3_bgc19_F_2.clm2.i.1900-01-01-00000.c050905.nc
  This initial dataset does not contain all the information that an initial dataset 
  produced by clm3_expa_19 would have. 

  CCSM:
  -------------------
  Checked out two versions of the ccsm tag ccsm3_0_brnchT_bgc19 tags and updated
  the clm version in one checkout to clm3_expa_38 and the other to clm3_expa_39.
  Created two test cases 
        ccsm3_bgc19_F_2_mod1 - used ccsm3_0_brnchT_bgc19 with clm3_expa_38 clm
        ccsm3_bgc19_F_2_mod2 - used ccsm3_0_brnchT_bgc19 with clm3_expa_39 clm
  Verified that running the output after a month was bfb with the two cases.
  (Note that ccsm3_bgc_19 will not give bit-for-bit with 
  ccsm3_0_brnchT_bgc19 with clm3_expa_38 clm - this needs to be looked into).
  Also verified that ccsm3_bgc19_F_2_mod2 gave bfb restarts (ran 1 month, restarted
  and ran another month).

Changes answers: the non-isotope results are bit-for-bit against clm3_expa_37, 
	except that the variable xsmrpool has been added as a new carbon state
        variable, replacing some of the functionality of the cpool variable.
        So comparisons against clm3_expa_37 will differ in cpool, but this 
        does not change the behavior of the rest of the prognostic pools.

The overall logic was to add new instances of the carbon state and carbon flux
derived types at the pft and column level to hold the c13 variables.
Discrimination is calcualted in CanopyFluxes(), and the state variable update
routines are based on the C13/(C13+C12) ratios for the upstream pools.  There
is now a C13 state and C13 flux associated with each of the origianl C state
and C flux variables. A number of new pps and pepv variables have also been
added as diagnostics for the C13 discrimination during assimilation.

This code passed the clm offline test suite as:
test-model.pl -res T31 -c clm3_expa_37
whith the caveat as above for bfb comparisons against expa_37 for cpool.

Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store:
Changes made:

1. Fix PLAI calculation in CASA'
   Added an initialization of stress factors in CASAPhenology for every
   timestep.
2. Fix PET calculate in CASA'
   Changed surface pressure variable used to forc_pbot which is required for
   CCSM configuration.  Moved the call to CASAPot_Evptr back down into casa()
   subroutine because of a bug on the Cray X1E which caused crashes in some
   configurations.
3. Moved calculation of watopt, watdry, sz, watoptc, watdryc, and szc for
   CASA' to initCASA() since they need to be calculated only once.
4. Removed nstep>1 requirement for CASA' routines by moving them to a later
   stage in driver (after Biogeophysics2).
5. Moved a vector directive in CASAMod.
6. Broke two long lines (write statements) in clm_csmMod which cause problems
   for the Cray compilers.
7. Replaced the second t_startf() around the call to driver2() in program_csm
   to a t_stopf().

Ran test-model on IBM (cheetah) for T31cnoff, T31cnoffallpfts, T31, and
T31allpfts.

One-line Summary: made driver.F90 into a module with two run phases
Requires change in build system: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: yes (see below)
Tested to work with CAM:  yes (see below)
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit) (offline) or Yes (same-to-roundoff) (cam, ccsm)
Changes made:
	
1) modified driver.F90 so that it is not a module containing
   subroutines driver1 and driver2. This is a step necessary to make
   clm an ESMF gridded component. The commmunication calls in CCSM
   mode have now been moved out of driver and into program_csm.F90.
   Routine driver1 contains the code executed between the CCSM send
   and receive calls. Routine driver2 contains the history and restart
   updates, as well as calls to the DGVM and RTM drivers (if the CPP
   tokens are defined). This involved mods to program_off.F90,
   program_csm.F90 and clm_camMod.F90.

2) modified the interface to initialize and driver so that declination
   angles and calendar day were passed in (caldayp1, declinp1) rather
   than the orbital parameters (eccen, obliqr, lambm0, mvelpp). This
   also involved mods to SurfaceAlbedo.F90 and DGVMMod.F90.

3) modified clm_camMod.f90 and program_csm.F90 so that the grid
   received from cam or the coupler would no longer overwrite the clm
   grid if differences were less than 1.e-6. Now, if differences in
   the corresponding grids are greater than 1.e-6, the model will
   stop, otherwise, the clm grid read in will be used. This leads to
   round-off level differences in cam and clm compared to the case when
   the grids were over-written.

4) Modifed clm_varsur.F90 so that external grid information was
   removed and moved to the appropriate component model.

5) Summary of modified files:
   biogeochem/DGVMMod.F90,v

Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: Yes (new-physics)
Changes made:
1. Removed exponential decrease in saturated hydraulic condicutivity with depth (modified iniTimeConst.F90)
2. Set smpmax = -2.57e5 (=-2.5Mpa) in clmtypeInit.F90, to better agree with the observed soil water potential at stomatal closure for most trees and grasses.  The original value was -1.55e5 (=-1.5MPa), which is a wetter soil than is observed to cause complete stomatal closure for most species.  The new value is still not negative enough for drought-tolerant species like semiarid shrubs.
3. Modified the qflx_over (surface runoff) term, keeping the components unchanged that relate to impermeable and saturated soils, but turning off this flux entirely for unsaturated soils.
4. Modified the qflx_drai (drainage flux) term (in SoilHydrology) to turn off the mid-layer drainage for both saturated and unsaturated fractions.  Remaining drainage terms are for drainage out of the bottom soil layer, and for drainage in excess of saturation in any layer.
5. Changed the implementation of rooting distribution from exponential to linear, with a bottom layer specified differently for woody and non-woody vegetation.  Woody vegetation is now set to decrease rooting distribution linearly with depth, ending at zero rooting for the bottom of the last soil layer.  Non-woody vegetation also decreases rooting distribution linearly with depth, ending at zero distribution at the bottom of layer 8 (of 10).  This gives a bottom for woody vegetation at 3.43 m, and a bottom for non-woody vegetation at 1.38 m.  THis change improves the access of both trees and grasses to water in deeper soil layers, compared to the original exponential depth distribution.

clm3_expa_21
Originator: thornton ( Peter Thornton)
Date: Fri Feb 18 12:42:48 MST 2005
Model: CLM
Version: CLM3.expa.21
One-line Summary: Mods in prep for C4MIP runs: dynamic N deposition, changed N fixation, moved order of calls in driver
Requires change in build system: no
(one-line description of changes: Makefile, include files, directories, etc.)
(Detailed description below)
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: Yes (new-physics)
Changes made:
1. Implemented dynamic N deposition through single netcdf file with annual
timeseries.  Turn on with namelist variable fndepdyn = <filename>
2. Moved call to EcosystemDyn to the end of the timestep in driver, before mass balance checks, which are before Surface Albedo.  This changes answers slightly
because soil temperature is used in CNEcosystemDyn, and is being updated in
Biogeophysics2, which used to be called after ecosystemdyn, but is now called
before. No compelling science reason for doing this one way vs the other,
but doing it this way cleans up the order of calls in driver.
3. Moved the initialization of mass balance checking to the front of the
timestep, for C and N, which was done for water in expa_17.  This is in prep
for dynamic shifting of C and N mass due to dynamic landcover information.
Note that this code does not yet implement the C and N mass shifting required 
for mass balance under dynamic pft weight.  THat will come in my next tag.
4. Modified N fixation to use a siongle global constant instead of relating
it to NPP.  This speeds up the spinup, but it leaves unresolved the problem of
hpw to dynamically estimate a value for Nfix.
5. Modified tools/mksurfdata/mkpftMod.F90 to remove the commenting around the
complete PFT list that I had put in during testing for expa_17.  This will only 
affect use of the offline tool for creating new surface datasets.

Testing done:
ran test-model on bluesky (IBM).
Did extensive testing for restart and MPI/OMP configurations with the
dynamic N deposition capability.

Changes for CASA model version and vector mods for recent code changes

CASA-related changes:
1. Added pft-level clayfrac(:) variable which, like sandfrac(:), contains
   the first level clay fractions.  These are now set in iniTimeConst for
   all pfts since the sand3d(i,j,l) and clay3d(i,j,l) variables from which
   they are obtained are local to that subroutine.
2. Moved call to pftdyn_wbal_init() outside ifdef so that column-level
   h2ocan_loss(:) is initialized in all configurations since it is always
   used in Hydrology1Mod.F90.
3. Removed CASA from ifdef line so that water balance routines are
   performed in the CASA configuration with dynamic landuse.

Vector and performance mods:
1. Removed loop exits in BalanceCheckMod.F90 which prevented
   vectorization.
2. Modified filter construction loop in SurfaceAlbedoMod.F90 for
   vectorization.
3. Added vector directives for filter loop recently added to filterMod.F90
4. Added OpenMP and Cray Streaming directives to loop over clumps in
   filterMod.F90 since setFilters() is called repeatedly in dynamic
   landuse configuration.
5. Vectorized pftdynMod.F90.

Ran test-model on IBM (cheetah) and x86 Linux (anchorage) comparing with
clm3_expa_18.

Model: CLM
Version: CLM3.expa.17
One-line Summary: modifications to allow water conservation with dynamic pft weights
Requires change in build system: no
(one-line description of changes: Makefile, include files, directories, etc.)
(Detailed description below)
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: Yes (new-physics)
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store: (For changes that change answers)
Changes made:

Added code that references the pft weight shifts introduced in
clm3_expa_16, and alters state and flux variables to maintain water
mass balance across the weight shift.
1. added routine pftdyn_wbal, called from driver(), that calculates
   the necessary changes in state and flux variables.  The only state variable
   affected are the pft and column level h2ocan (intercepted water stored on
   canopy).  For timesteps in which weight of a PFT increases, the water
   state is spread over the increased area, resulting in lower h2ocan
   concentration, but conserved mass.  For increases from zero weight in the
   previous timestep, the previous h2ocan mass is controlled to be zero.
   For timesteps in which a pft weight is decreasing, the h2ocan mass
   associated with the lost area is transferred to to top of the snow/soil
   column, through a flux in parallel with throughfall. Weight shifting is
   constrained to occur on albedo timesteps.
2. Beginning water balance for the timestep is assessed prior to the weight
   shift, and the end balance is assessed following the weight shift.  Since
   the water balance is assessed at the column level, using pft-level h2ocan
   states that have been averaged to the column based on the new pft weights,
   this ordering will catch mass balance errors associated with incorrectly
   accounting for the pft-level changes in h2ocan mass.
3. pftdyn_interp() is also modified from clm3_expa_16, so that now if a 
   pftdyn dataset is specified and the current model time is before the first
   year of the pftdyn dataset, the first year of the pftdyn dataset is used
   until the model time enters the pftdyn dataset time range.  Likewise, if
   the model time is after the final year of the pftdyn dataset, pft weights
   from the last year of the pftdyn dataset are used for the rest of the 
   simulation.

clm3_expa_16
Originator: mvertens ( Mariana Vertenstein)
Date: Tue Dec 21 13:38:17 MST 2004
Model: CLM
Version: CLM3.expa.16
One-line Summary: incorporated dynamic land use functionality
Requires change in build system: yes (see notes below)
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: yes (no comparison made however)
Machines tested: IBM, Linux(lf95)
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself, Peter Thornton
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit) 
Changes made:
1) removed generation of surface datasets as part of CLM and created offline tool
   see $ROOTDIR/tools/mksurfdata and look at README file in this directory

2) parameters:
   clm_varpar.F90 - the paramater maxpatch_pft is now set to a cpp token MAXPATCH_PFT
   (note that the cpp token can be set to numpft+1)

3) namelist:
   namelist addition - the following variables have been added to the namelist
     rank_vegpfts, allocate_all_vegpfts, fpftdyn  
   - the following defaults are set for these variables
     fpftdyn = ' '
     if (maxpatch_pft == numpft+1) then	
        allocate_all_vegpfts = .true.
        rank_vegpfts = .false.
     else
        allocate_all_vegpfts = .false.	
        rank_vegpfts = .true. 
     end if
   - if fpftdyn is non-blank: 
      - the dynamic landuse dataset specified by fpftdyn is used at
        every time step to read in and interpolate the weights and 
        a new call to setFilters is done after the weights are read in
      - rank_vegpfts must be false and allocate_all_vegpfts must be true
        if fpftdyn is non-blank
      - SCAM, DGVM and CASA cannot be defined if fpftdyn dyn is non-blank
   - the following namelist options can still be read in (for backwards compatibility)
     but currently do not do anything
        mksrf_fvegtyp, mksrf_fsoitex, mksrf_fsoicol, mksrf_flanwat, &
        mksrf_fglacier, mksrf_furban, mksrf_flai, mksrf_offline_fgrid, &
        mksrf_offline_edgen, mksrf_offline_edgee, mksrf_offline_edges, &
        mksrf_offline_edgew, mksrf_offline_fnavyoro

4) surfFileMod.F90:
   this routine has been completely rewritten in order to facilitate the
   addition of dynamic land use (fpftdyn)
   the public interface - surfrd now contains the following logic:

   surfrd(veg, wtxy)
       call surfrd_get_grid(ncid) 
       call surfrd_wtxy_special(ncid, pctspec, veg, wtxy)
   #if (! defined DGVM)     
       if (rank_vegpfts) then
          call surfrd_wtxy_veg_rank(ncid, pctspec, veg, wtxy)
       else
          call surfrd_wtxy_veg_all(ncid, pctspec, veg, wtxy)
       end if
   #else
       call surfrd_wtxy_veg_dgvm(pctspec, veg, wtxy)
   #endif

   routine surfrd_get_grid reads in grid information from the surface dataset
   and if COUP_CAM or COUP_CSM are defined - compares this grid information
   with that obtained from either the CAM or CSM via the arrays 
   (ext_longxy, ext_latixy, etc)

5) any calculations involving weights have been removed from inicFileMod.F90
   and restFileMod.F90 and put into DriverInitMod.F90. All future coding should
   maintain this requirement the inicFileMod.F90 and restFileMod.F90 do not
   need updated weights for any calculations.

6) initializeMod.F90:
   this routine was completely rewritten in order to facilitate the addition
   of dynamic land use (fpftdyn). New documentation in the routine should help
   the readability:

7) iniTimeConst.F90:
   The following arrays are now local to iniTimeConst.F90 which obtains their
   values in a separate read from the surface dataset. This was done to conserve
   memory as higher resolutions CLM versions are implemented.
     soic2d(lsmlon,lsmlat)         ! read in - soil color
     sand3d(lsmlon,lsmlat,nlevsoi) ! read in - soil texture: percent sand
     clay3d(lsmlon,lsmlat,nlevsoi) ! read in - soil texture: percent clay
     ndep(lsmlon,lsmlat)           ! read in - annual nitrogen deposition rate (gN/m2/yr)

8) iniTimeVar.F90
   this routine has been split up into module mkarbinitMod.f90 and initSurfAlbMod.F90.
   
9) COUP_CAM
   atm_lndMod.F90 and lp_coupling.F90 have been combined into a new module - 
   clm_camMod.F90. All the routines in lp_coupling.F90 are now private to clm_camMod.F90.

10) testing done:
   # summary of tests:
   # T42       : CN on , allocate_all_vegpfts = .true. , maxpatch_pft=4
   # T42cnoff  : CN off, allocate_all_vegpfts = .false., maxpatch_pft=4
   # T42allpfts: CN on , allocate_all_vegpfts = .true. , maxpatch_pft=numpft+1
   # DGVM      : CN off, allocate_all_vegpfts = .false., maxpatch_pft=10
   all final tests were done on ibm and linux(lf95)
   - ran test-model.pl               -c clm3_expa_14 successfully (ibm, linux)
   - ran test-model.pl -res T42cnoff -c clm3_expa_14 successfully (ibm, linux)
   - ran test-model.pl -res DGVM     -c clm3_expa_14 successfully (ibm)
   - verified that ccsm3_0_1_beta03_clm3_expa_16 and ccsm3_0_1_beta03_clm3_expa_14
     were bfb for TSM.01a.T31_gx3v5.I.blackforest
   - verified that ccsm3_0_1_beta03_clm3_expa_16 TER.01a.T31_gx3v5.F.blackforest passed
   - ran test-model.pl successfully cam (cam3_0_21_clm3_expa_16) but did not
     compare to cam3_0_31 (***this still needs to be done***)
   - created dynamic landuse dataset for 1980 and 1981 that had identical
     pft information as the corresponding surface dataset - verified
     that interpolation	was working correctly - however, was not able
     to introduce roundoff level changes for a long time period when
     these dynamic datatset was used since the interpolation introduced
     roundoff level changes in the weights which corrpespondingly
     introduced higher than roundoff level changes in the simulation
     due to the averaging of pft->col weights.

Changes made:

CN Vector Modifications
-----------------------
Modified all CN source files in biogeochem/ and main/ to provide vector
performance of code on Cray X1.  Performed offline model validation test on
Cray X1 compared by Peter Thornton against results from the IBM.

subgridAve Vector Modifications
-------------------------------
Modified the subgrid averaging routines to provide vector performance since
they must now be called every timestep for dynamic prescribed vegetation.
CPP_VECTOR must be defined for these code sections to be used; otherwise, the
more compact non-vector version is compiled.

CASA' Flux and Carbon Pool Initialization
-----------------------------------------
fco2, fnpp, and Cflux are now initialized to 0._r8 in initCASA() so that
they are scaled correctly up to the gridcell level.  Vegetation and wood
carbon pools are now scaled either by 1.0 or 0.0 since CASA initial carbon
pool file contains values in terms of vegetation percent averages.

test-model was run on blackforest and cheetah (IBMs) and anchorage (Linux).
test-model no longer runs correctly on the Cray X1, but the validation
demonstrated correct results on the Cray X1.

One-line Summary: added allocation for all pfts on new surface dataset
Requires change in build system: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM, SGI, Linux(lf95)
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself, Peter Thornton
Changes answers:  Yes (same-to-roundoff) - climate validation is needed
Changes made:
	
1) Introduced a new clm namelist, allocate_all_vegpfts, that if set to
   true will reserve memory for numpft+1 pfts on the vegetated
   landunit. This namelist setting is only valid when the new format
   surface dataset is used (with all possible pfts present on the
   gridcell). This namelist setting is not valid in DGVM mode.

2) Changed the calculations so that are done only on pfts where the
   weight relative to the gridcell is greater than 0.

3) Changed the history file code so that if xy output is requested,
   the history buffer is always on the gridcell level and mapping to
   the gridcell is done for every history field at every timestep.

4) loops that went from 1,maxpatch_pft were modified to go from
   1,max_pft_per_col where max_pft_per_col is set to numpft+1 in 
   clm_varpar.F90.
   
5) Changes were as follows:

  o) modified clm_varpar so that 

     integer, parameter :: max_pft_per_gcell = (numpft+1) + 4 + maxpatch_cft
     integer, parameter :: max_pft_per_col   = numpft+1

  o) The following files were change so that calculations were only done
     if the pft weight relative to the gridcell was > 0.

      biogeochem/CNFireMod.F90
      biogeochem/CNGapMortalityMod.F90
      biogeochem/CNPhenologyMod.F90
      biogeochem/DUSTMod.F90
      biogeophys/BalanceCheckMod.F90
      biogeophys/Biogeophysics2Mod.F90
      biogeophys/DriverInitMod.F90
      biogeophys/SoilHydrologyMod.F90
      biogeophys/SoilTemperatureMod.F90
      biogeophys/SurfaceAlbedoMod.F90
      biogeophys/Attic/SurfaceRadiationMod.F90
      main/CNiniTimeVar.F90
      main/clm_csmMod.F90
      main/lnd2atmMod.F90
      main/subgridAveMod.F90

   o) Rewrote CanopyFluxesMod.F90 so that calls to 
      Stomata, StomataCN and FrictionVelocity would not result in array copies
      (modified Stomata and StomataCN to point to clm3 type arrays rather than
      passing these in as arguments).  Also changed calculations so that
      they were only done if the pft weight relative to the gridcell was > 0.

   o) Removed unnecesary variables from DGVMMod.F90

   o) Changed biogeochem/STATICEcosysDynMod.F90 so that logic is more extensible
      in setting mlai, msai, mhvt, mhvtb to non-zero values 

   o) Removed the Error check: global sum fld_o = global sum fld_i in areaMod.F90.
      this resulted in erroneous error messages when running with a reduced grid.

   o) Added allocate_all_vegpfts to clm_varctl.F90 and controlMod.F90. 
      By default this is set to .false.

   o) Modified FilterMod.F90 so that pft filters are only calculated where the
      pft weights relative to the gridcell are greater than 0.

   o) Modified histFileMod.F90 so that history buffer is at the gridcell level
      when xy output is requested. Also 1d history buffer is only updated when
      the weight relative to the gridcell is greater than 0. Also, modified
      histFldsMod.F90 so that RSSHA, RSSUN are now time averaged fields
      and TSNOW, SNOWLIQ and SNOWICE are now instantaneous fields.
 
   o) Modified inicFileMod.F90 so that T_REF2M was added. 

   o) Modified initSubGridMod so that npfts_per_lunit = numpft+1 if allocate_all_vegpfts
      is true.

   o) Modified mlai.F90, mkpft.F90 and mksrfdatMod.F90 so that only new surface data format
      is created.

6) Testing Done:

   incorporated allocate_all_pfts=.true. as default in test-model.pl

   linux (lf95) (anchorage)
      ran test-model.pl               successfully (CN on , full alloc on )
      ran test-model.pl -res T42cnoff successfully (CN off, full alloc on )
      ran test-model.noalloc.pl       successfully (CN on , full alloc off)

      Comparing the diagnostic output from for alloc-on and alloc-off for CN on,
      the output was the same for first 5 time steps and then started diverging. 
      A climate simulation needs to be done to verify that the roundoff level 
      differences results in the same climate.

   ibm-sp (blackforest)
      ran test-model.noalloc.pl and test-model.pl (CN is on)
         diagnostic output was the same for the first 3 timesteps and then started diverging
      ran test-model.noalloc.pl -res T42cnoff and test-model.pl -res T42CNoff (CN is off)
         diagnostic output was the same for the first 8 timesteps and then started diverging
      ran test-model.noalloc.pl -res T42cnoff compared with clm3_expa_12
         verified that only roundoff differences appeared in the history file fields accept
         for RSSHA, RSSUN, TSNOW, SNOWLIQ, SNOWICE (see above)

clm3_expa_12
Originator: thornton ( Peter Thornton)
Date: Mon Oct 18 13:03:57 MDT 2004
Model: CLM
Version: CLM3.expa.12
One-line Summary: Moved surface albedo call to end of driver loop.
Requires change in build system: no
(one-line description of changes: Makefile, include files, directories, etc.)
(Detailed description below)
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: yes
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: Yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: no
Code reviewed by: Mariana Vertenstein, Peter Thornton
Changes answers: Yes (new-physics)
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store: (For changes that change answers)
ccsm3_K_sa1, ccsm3_K_sa2, ccsm3_K_cnsa1, ccsm3_K_cnsa2
Changes made:

Merged loop1 and loop2 in clm driver. Now surface albedo is called at the
end of the loop, and csm_send is called after the loop. This change is the
first step in getting all updates to prognostic variables moved to the end
of the timestep, in preparation for water and carbon isotope code.

Originator: forrest (Forrest Hoffman)
Date: Mon Sep 20 11:49:36 MDT 2004
Model: CLM
Version: CLM3.expa.11
One-line Summary: Added experimental CASA' carbon cycle model to CLM.  Renamed *_transfer* variables in CN code to *_xfer* and modified history field names to match.
Requires change in build system: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: yes
Machines tested: IBM (cheetah and blackforest), x86 Linux (anchorage), Cray X1 (phoenix)
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself, Jasmin John
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes made:

Added the CASA' carbon cycle model to the CLM code.  CASA' can be used by
compiling with the CASA and SUNSHA cpp variables set.  It can not be used
with either DGVM or CN enabled.

Renamed all *_transfer* variable in the CN code to *_xfer* and modified
history field names consistently, so *_TRANSFER* fields became *_XFER* fields.

Ran test-model on cheetah, blackforest, anchorage, and phoenix.

clm3_expa_10
Originator: mvertens ( Mariana Vertenstein)
Date: Wed Aug 25 11:10:34 MDT 2004
Model: CLM
Version: CLM3.expa.10
One-line Summary: put in new subgrid initialization interface
Requires change in build system: no (unless a new crop landunit is desired)
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit) (except for roundoff on 2d history files)
Changes made:
1) Removed cpp variable NOCOMPETE from code.
2) Added namelist variable create_crop_landunit.  
   This permits the user to decide if a separate crop landunit is to
   be created with the new surface dataset format (where all pfts appear).
   By default create_crop_andunit is set to .false.
   Removed logic that tied the use of new surface dataset format to the presence
   of a separate crop landunit.
   modified files:
     main/controlMod.F90
     main/surfFileMod.F90
     min/clm_varctl.F90.
3) Unified interface to create gridcells and landunits.
   modified files:
     main/Attic/decompMod.F90
     main/histFileMod.F90
     main/inicFileMod.F90
     main/Attic/initGridCellsMod.F90
   added files:
     main/initGridIndexMod.F90
     main/initSubgridMod.F90
   - all logic to create new landunits now goes in module initSubGridMod.F90.
   - If a new landunit (landunit_xxx) is to be created
      o subroutine get_gcell_info should be modified to contain logic for landunit_xxx
      o a new subroutine set_landunit_xxx should be added to the module
      o a new call to set_landunit_xxx should be added in subroutine initGridCells in 
        module subroutine initGridCellsMod.F90

       call set_landunit_veg_compete( &
            ltype=xxx, wtxy=wtxy, vegxy=vegxy, &
            i=i      , j=j      , gi=gi      , li=li      , ci=ci      , pi=pi, &
            i_sn=i_sn, j_sn=j_sn, gi_sn=gi_sn, li_sn=li_sn, ci_sn=ci_sn, pi_sn=pi_sn, &
            nump=nump, numc=numc, numl=numl, &
            land1d_sn_gi=land1d_sn_gi, cols1d_sn_li=cols1d_sn_li, cols1d_sn_gi=cols1d_sn_gi, &
            pfts1d_sn_ci=pfts1d_sn_ci, pfts1d_sn_li=pfts1d_sn_li, pfts1d_sn_gi=pfts1d_sn_gi)

       note - the only thing that is unique about this call is the setting of ltype.
4) Testing done
   a) ran test-model.pl (with CN on) and verified that code is bfb with clm3_expa_9.
      Note, however, that the 2d history output will have roundoff differences with 
      respect to clm3_expa_9 due to the new calculation of the weights in initSubGridMod.F90.
      Also verified that the initial datasets created with clm3_exap_10 were bfb with clm3_expa_9.
   b) verified that clm3_expa_10 is bfb with clm3_expa_9 when create_crop_landunit=.true..
      and a new format surface dataset is used 
      (fsurdat = '/fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm2/srfdata/csm/surface-data.128x064_atm.gx1v3_ocn.allpfts_c040426.nc).

One-line Summary: Added fire to CN code, other minor mods
Requires change in build system: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Tested to work with CAM: no
Machines tested: IBM
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: no
Code reviewed by: myself
Changes answers: Yes (new-physics)
Changes made:
1. Added Thonicke fire algorithm, working mainly from 2001 paper. Modifications
   to that algorithm made to represent fire occurrence on every timestep, instead of
   as an annual process. Set cpp variable NOFIRE in job script to eliminate the 
   effects of fire algorithm (results bit-for-bit with previous code).
2. Modified CNPrecisionControlMod.F90 to truncate C and N state variables when they
   go below a specified threshold value.  Tracking these modifications in new
   truncation state variables, which accumulate the net changes over a run.
3. Moved CN state update calls and summary call into CNEcosysdyn, from driver.
