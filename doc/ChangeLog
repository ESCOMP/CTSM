One-line Summary: Recalculate h2osno for the sake of SnowCapping

Purpose of changes
------------------

SnowCapping decides whether to remove excess snow based on
h2osno. However, at the point where this is called,h2osno is out of sync
with (h2osoi_liq + h2osoi_ice): Those variables can be changed slightly
in SnowWater (which is called before SnowCapping), yet h2osno isn't
recalculated based on those changes.

I don't think this causes a big problem in practice, but it seems like
it would improve code understandability if we had the general rule that
any code that references h2osno is using a version of h2osno that is in
sync with (h2osoi_liq + h2osoi_ice). This is also needed to prevent
answer changes in an upcoming major refactor.

One-line Summary: Make wetland snow resetting behavior more explicit

Purpose of changes
------------------

There is some code that zeroes out h2osno over thawed wetlands. It seems
like the intended behavior here is to zero out the entire snow
pack. Currently, however, this only zeros out a very thin (zero-layer)
snow pack. For now, I'm adding an snl==0 conditional to make this
behavior explicit; long-term, we'd like to change this to actually zero
out the whole snow pack. (At that time, this code block should probably
be moved to a more appropriate home, as noted in comments in issue
ESCOMP/ctsm#735.)

Also, unrelated change in run_sys_tests: support machine-specific
baseline directory, in order to support new default location for CTSM
baselines on cheyenne.

One-line Summary: Fix FUN bug (frac_ideal_C_use was backwards in regard to delta_CN), and replace Ball-Berry mbbopt with the CLM4.5 version

Purpose of changes
------------------

Carbon allocation to uptake responds to CN(uptake-cost) and CN(actual). The intended implementation is: For C:N 
less than the target C:N, C allocation is reduced with cost. For C:N greater than the target C:N, C allocation 
is increased with high C:N. However, the actual implementation is reversed. This change fixes that problem.

Also the Ball-Berry mbbopt values had been changed in the creation of CLM5.0, as part of the tuning, but the new
values don't work well (as our final tuning uses Medlyn photosynshesis rather than Ball-Berry). This brings the values
for Ball-Berry for CLM5.0 back to the CLM4.5 values.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):  #704 #705

   Fixes #705 -- Ball-Berry parameters in CLM5.0 should go back to the previous values in CLM4.5

One-line Summary: Add water tracers to CanopyHydrologyMod

Purpose of changes
------------------

Major overhaul of CanopyHydrologyMod in order to support water tracers.

The part of CanopyHydrology that was actually dealing with canopy
hydrology has now been broken out into a number of small routines in
order to separate flux calculations from state updates. This is needed
in order to calculate tracer versions of the relevant variables, which
is now done here.

The parts of CanopyHydrology that were NOT dealing with canopy hydrology
have been moved to more appropriate homes. They have not yet been
tracerized, but will be soon.

This also makes some minor changes to diagnostic fields related to
canopy hydrology. Of particular note: QDRIP now has a different meaning:
it now corresponds to the excess liquid water that runs off from the
canopy (and is inactive by default).

The design of this broken-out code was developed in consultation with
Mike Barlage, Erik Kluzek, Negin Sobhani, Sean Swenson and Mariana
Vertenstein. We plan to apply this design moving forward to other parts
of the code that need tracerization. See also
<https://github.com/billsacks/prototypes-ctsm-canopyhydrology_tracers>.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Resolves ESCOMP/ctsm#360 - Implement water isotopes for
  CanopyHydrology
- Resolves ESCOMP/ctsm#709 - QDRIP diagnostic field misleadingly named
- Partially addresses ESCOMP/ctsm#503 - Clean up CanopyHydrology
  (We still need to clean up / tracerize the parts that have now been
  moved elsewhere.)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
- Changed meaning of QDRIP diagnostic field: it now corresponds to
  qflx_liqcanfall rather than qflx_prec_grnd_patch, and is default
  inactive. (There is no longer a diagnostic field corresponding to
  qflx_prec_grnd_patch, but there are separate diagnostic fields for the
  rain and snow portions of this, both default inactive.)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse

     Ensured no-greater-than-roundoff-level by:

     First, generated baselines using code with these diffs (note extra
     parentheses in multiplication):

     Then ran test suite on 1cc9d38a. This is very close to the final
     branch, but had a few small tweaks in place to get bit-for-bit:

     1. Under some conditions, the final branch code resets slightly
        negative snocan and liqcan to 0, where master did not. This
        commit puts in place temporary code to maintain the slightly
        negative values under these conditions, along with a check to
        ensure that the values are really always only slightly negative
        in this situation.

     2. When snocan > snocanmx, master reset snocan to exactly snocanmx,
        whereas the final branch code can result in snocan being
        roundoff-level different from snocanmx, and similar for
        liqcan. This commit puts in place temporary code to set snocan
        to snocanmx under appropriate circumstances, and liqcan to
        liqcanmx, along with a check to ensure that this is only leading
        to roundoff-level changes in these state variables.

     3. Multiplies then divides a flux by dtime in one place

     4. Has parentheses around a partial sum to ensure same order of
        operations as before

     This was bfb with the baselines generated with the diff noted
     above, except for roundoff-level changes in SNOCAN in one grid cell
     in just one test
     (SMS_D_Ld1.f19_g17.I1850Clm45Cn.hobart_gnu.clm-default; old:

    while now they are declared "double" in the params.nc files. I
    showed that the change was no greater than single-precision roundoff
    by writing the new and old values to the lnd and cesm log files and
    confirming differences smaller than 1.e-6.

Detailed list of changes
------------------------

 - Updated the clm5 and clm4.5 params.nc files to contain the previously
 hard-coded parameters that Katie Dagon recommended moving out of the
 code (listed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRmcB0xz7CjVP6ljUoCehJx49Usxsore5ma4mWcvQwM/edit#gid=0)
 - Now read the parameters in the modules that use them

One-line Summary: Remove excess canopy liquid/snow regardless of temperature

Purpose of changes
------------------

Previously: if it was above freezing, snow was allowed to accumulate on
the canopy beyond the specified capacity, and if it was below freezing,
liquid was allowed to accumulate beyond the specified capacity. Sean
Swenson, Keith Oleson and Dave Lawrence agreed that this seems wrong.

This tag changes the behavior so that both liquid and snow canopy
capacities are enforced regardless of temperature.

One-line Summary: Support for NWP configuration, NLDAS grid and NLDAS datm forcing

Purpose of changes
------------------

This tag includes a set of changes that, together, provide support for
running an initial Numerical Weather Prediction version of CTSM over the
Continental U.S.

(1) NWP configuration: The changes in this configuration relative to the
    climate (CLM5) configuration mainly target decreasing runtime by
    removing features that are expensive and not as important for NWP
    time scales (days to months rather than many years) and space scales
    (high resolution):

    - Single dominant landunit; if vegetated, single dominant PFT

    - Only 5 soil layers, down to 3 m

    - Only 5 snow layers

    - Plant hydraulic stress off

    - Ball-Berry rather than Medlyn stomatal conductance method (this is
      a side-effect of turning plant hydraulic stress off, and is not
      itself a critical aspect of the NWP configuration)

    - Maximum of 3 iterations to compute canopy fluxes

    - MEGAN is off

    Note that the NWP compset triggers changes in two new xml variables:
    CLM_CONFIGURATION ('clm' vs. 'nwp'; this controls things of a more
    scientific nature, like whether plant hydraulic stress is on or
    off), and CLM_STRUCTURE ('standard' vs. 'fast'; this controls
    structural things like the maximum number of landunits per grid cell
    and the soil layer structure). Thus, you can create a case that is a
    hybrid between the CLM and NWP configurations by changing these two
    xml variables independently.

(2) NLDAS2 regional grid: 0.125 deg grid over the Continental U.S.

(3) Updated version of MOSART with support for the same NLDAS2 regional
    grid

(4) NLDAS2 data atmosphere forcing: over the same regional grid; forcing
    data are available from 1980 - 2018. (We have excluded 1979 because
    a small amount of data were missing for that year, and we didn't
    have a good way to handle those missing data.)

These changes can be used independently or all together. However, note
that you will get garbage if you try to use the new NLDAS2 datm forcing
for a run that extends beyond the boundaries of the NLDAS2 domain.

There are three new NWP compsets:
- I2000Ctsm50NwpSpGswpGs: GSWP3 datm forcing; meant for global runs or
  regional runs outside the NLDAS domain
- I2000Ctsm50NwpSpNldasGs: NLDAS2 datm forcing; meant for regional runs
  over the NLDAS domain or some portion of it
- I2000Ctsm50NwpSpNldasRsGs: Same as above, but with a stub runoff model
  in place of MOSART, for runs that aren't interested in having a runoff
  model and for which you want improved throughput

The alias for the new grid is: nldas2_rnldas2_mnldas2 (indicating that
we're using the nldas2 grid for land/atmosphere, runoff ('r') and the
ocean mask ('m').

One-line Summary: Change year alignment for present-day I compsets

Purpose of changes
------------------

Change year alignment for present-day I compsets (typically, these
compsets have aliases beginning with "I2000"), in order to work better
for cases that are meant to replicate particular years.

(1) Start the model in year 2000 rather than year 1

(2) Change datm's year alignment so that model year 2000 uses
observations from year 2000, model year 2001 uses observations from year
2001, etc.

One-line Summary: Fix carbon isotope bug that caused wrong answers for isotopes under transient land-use change

Purpose of changes
------------------

We currently have a bug so that for transient land-use change cases answers are different starting in soil
carbon when Carbon isotopes (use_c13, or use_c14) are on versus off. Answers are identical if there is no
land-use change. The bug does cause bulk Carbon (C12) to be slightly different, but qualitatively the same.
There is a significant impact to the Carbon isotope simulation however. The bug was causing changes in isotopic
pools to be directed to the bulk Carbon. Because, isotopes are so much smaller than bulk Carbon, this doesn't 
cause a marked difference in the bulk Carbon simulation. But, the lack of the change in the isotopic pool
does have a meaningful impact on the simulation of the Carbon isotopic fields.

Also added a general test for this and specific one to catch this case. And did some updates on documentation
files, and a small bug fix for run_sys_tests.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #692 #675 #686
 #675 -- Answers differ when carbon isotopes are on under transient cases

One-line Summary: Change h2ocan to a purely diagnostic variable

Purpose of changes
------------------

Previously, h2ocan_patch was maintained through the driver loop as the
sum of liqcan_patch and snocan_patch. However, there were places where
it was updated separately (though consistently) - i.e., it was not
simply a matter of 'h2ocan = liqcan + snocan'. This made the code
more complex, especially for the upcoming addition of water tracers.

This tag changes h2ocan_patch to be a purely diagnostic variable, set
once at the end of the driver loop. Prognostic equations that used to
use h2ocan now use liqcan and snocan, either directly or indirectly via
a temporary variable set equal to the current value of liqcan+snocan.

This tag also completely removes support for snowveg_flag = 'OFF' in
order to clean up the code.

In addition, this tag renames the namelist variable snowveg_flag to
snowveg_affects_radiation (now a logical).

Finally, this tag includes a minor change to always compute fcansno,
even if snowveg_affects_radiation is false, in order to simplify the
code.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

     I split these changes into two pieces: (1) an answer-changing piece
     where I made minimal changes to replace uses of h2ocan_patch with
     liqcan+snocan (via temporary h2ocan variables holding this sum),
     and (2) non-answer-changing code cleanup. (1) consisted of the
     first two commits on this branch (461cafea and f195c105). With the
     changes in (1), I added checks near each change to ensure that the
     new expression differed by no more than roundoff from the old
     (using an absolute cutoff of 1e-13). I ran the full test suite with
     these checks in place, and generated new baselines. I then compared
     the changes in (2) with the baselines from (1); this cleanup step
     was bit-for-bit except for roundoff-level changes in the
     now-diagnostic-only field H2OCAN.

     As noted in ESCOMP/ctsm#689, the changes in (1) were larger than I
     expected, presumably because initially roundoff-level differences
     can lead to divergent code behavior. The most obvious example of
     this is in the check of h2ocan > 0 in subroutine FracWet. I have
     found that, due to roundoff errors, it is possible for h2ocan_patch
     > 0 by roundoff, while (liqcan_patch + snocan_patch) <= 0 by
     roundoff. (Presumably the reverse could also be true, though I
     haven't seen that – but I haven't spent much time looking for it.)

     Soon, we plan to do a more rigorous test to double check that this
     change is not climate-changing.

One-line Summary: Change clm4_5: Use Justin Perket snow on vegetation

Purpose of changes
------------------

This tag changes the behavior of clm4_5, making it now use Justin
Perket's snow on vegetation parameterization. This parameterization was
originally introduced in clm4_5_1_r112. At the time it was only used for
clm5_0 cases. This tag uses that parameterization for clm4_5 cases, too,
so that (like clm5_0) they use snowveg_flag = 'ON_RAD' (i.e., vegetation
snow canopy on with albedo influence).

This changes climate for clm4_5, mainly through albedo changes,
particularly in the shoulder seasons.

The reason for this change is to allow an upcoming cleanup of the
relationship between h2ocan, snocan and liqcan. (See
https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/issues/199 for details.)

This tag also no longer allows snowveg_flag = 'OFF'. However, code
cleanup is deferred to a follow-on tag, in order to separate the answer
changes in this tag from the no-greater-than-roundoff-level changes in
the follow-on tag.

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Need to clean up code involving snowveg_flag, liqcan, snocan and
  h2ocan. I will do this in a follow-on tag.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Added a test with snowveg_flag = 'ON'. (At least some of the code
  paths triggered by this setting were previously covered by clm45
  cases. Now that both clm45 and clm50 use snowveg_flag = 'ON_RAD',
  there was some uncovered code. This new test covers this code.)
- Changed long single-point tests to use Qian forcing: With the default
  GSWP3 forcing, the vast majority of the runtime was being spent in
  datm. In addition, I was getting repeated failures of
  ERS_Lm54_Mmpi-serial.1x1_numaIA.I2000Clm50BgcCropGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput,
  I think due to memory issues; I'm hopeful that changing the datm
  forcing will help with that.

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Clm45 compsets
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

      New climate (as in clm4_5_1_r112 for clm5_0); the main impact is
      through albedo changes, particularly in the shoulder seasons.

      Changes in clm4_5 cases are due to:

      (1) Using snowveg_flag = 'ON_RAD' rather than 'OFF'

      (2) Changed initial conditions for canopy water: Rather than using
          H2OCAN, which is the meaningful state variable on previous
          clm4_5 initial conditions files, now we use LIQCAN and
          SNOCAN. These may be 0, although at least some clm4_5 initial
          conditions files (including the two non-Fates out-of-the-box
          clm4_5 initial conditions files) have non-zero (though still
          reasonable) LIQCAN for reasons I can't understand.

      (Also changes answers for
      ERS_D_Ln9_P480x3.f19_g16.I2000Clm50SpGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-waccmx_offline,
      which uses a clm45 initial file.)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Limit landunit presence with thresholds set in the namelist

Purpose of changes
------------------

 Faster simulations. Motivated by NWP applications:
 - Introduce user-defined namelist parameters to use as thresholds
 above which landunit areas are kept and
 below which landunit areas are removed.
 - Introduce user-defined logical namelist parameter to collapse the up to
 three urban landunits to the dominant urban landunit.

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
 - New namelist variables with valid real values from 0._r8 to 100._r8, where
 0 means "do nothing" and other values determine the threshold above
 which to keep the landunit in a gridcell. The new variables are:
 toosmall_soil
 toosmall_crop
 toosmall_glacier
 toosmall_lake
 toosmall_wetland
 toosmall_urban
 - New logical namelist variable collapse_urban. If .true. then the up to
 three urban landunits collapse to the dominant urban landunit.

 - Introduced call to new subroutine collapse_individual_lunits that uses
 the user-defined namelist variables listed above to determine whether
 a landunit gets kept or removed from a gridcell.
 - Introduced new call to collapse_to_dominant for when collapse_urban = .true.
 - Introduced error checks that do not allow coexistence of transient
 simulations and the toosmall_* variables OR the n_dom_pfts/n_dom_landunits
 variables OR the collapse_urban parameter.

One-line Summary: Fixing the balance check to check for possible errors over all columns/patches

Purpose of changes
------------------
Up until now, the BalanceCheckMod code in biogeophysics did not check all
the possible errors over all columns or patches with the error threshold for
aborting clm and it merely compared the last column/patch found (where
warning threshold is met) with the error threshold.
Therefore, there was always a possibility that the abort is not triggered
when it should have been. This issue was first mentioned in ctsm issue #55
for soil energy balance check, but a similar issue is also present for
other balance checks in BalanceCheckMod.F90 .

Below is the list of the balance checks with a similar issue:
1. Water balance check
2. Snow balance check
3. Solar radiation energy balance check
4. Longwave radiation energy balance check
5. Surface energy balance check
6. Soil energy balance check (Issue #55)

For remediating this issue, we used MAXVAL and MAXLOC Fortran intrinsic functions
to compare the largest error with the warning and error thresholds instead
of checking the last column or looping over all columns.


In addition, this PR also makes slight changes to ./run_sys_tests outputi/case
directory structure. Previously for each case in a test suite, there were 
two set of directories created by run_sys_tests as follows:
 * one directory which included run/ and bld/ and named as $SCRATCH/[case-name]....
 * The case directory which included logs , timings, CaseDocs/, and misc. scripts
     for ./case.build, ./case.submit... under $SCRATCH/tests-[testID]/[case-name]....

This made debugging confusing and populated many folders in user's scratch.
Now, for every case in a test, all directories related to that case
including bld/ and run/ directories are nested under the case directory under $SCRATCH/tests-[testID]/[case-name]....
This is now similar to ./create_test output folder structure.

One-line Summary: Subtract virtual states to reduce dynbal fluxes for transient glaciers

Purpose of changes
------------------

Up until now, when computing the dynbal correction (conservation) fluxes
for transient glacier columns, we have been (1) counting the mass and
energy in the ice column as if that is a real state, but on the other
hand (2) NOT accounting for the fact that glacier columns don't
represent the soil under glacier. These two issues work in opposite
directions, but (1) dominates, because there is much more ice (and
energy, I think) in the roughly 50 m of glacial ice than there is in a
typical 50 m soil column.

In discussing this issue with Bill Lipscomb, we came up with the idea of
subtracting some baseline value from each glacier column. I think that,
as long as we subtract the same baseline value throughout an entire
simulation for a given column, we will still conserve mass and energy
through dynamic landunit transitions.

So, here we subtract baseline values from glacier columns, accounting
for the two issues mentioned above: (1) we subtract the water and energy
in the glacier ice, because this is a virtual state in CTSM, and (2) we
add the water and energy from the vegetated column(s), to account for
the fact that we don't have an explicit representation of
soil-under-glacier (this carries the assumption that the
soil-under-glacier has the same state as the initial vegetated state in
that grid cell). We set these baselines in initialization, so they begin
equal to the cold start state. Water and ice in the glacial ice stay
fixed over the course of a simulation, so the cold start values should
be the same as the current values at any point in time. The heat content
of the glacial ice does change over time, but by subtracting this
baseline value, we can potentially reduce the dynbal sensible heat
fluxes (however, note that it's also possible that these sensible heat
fluxes could increase when subtracting the cold start value, if ice
temperatures are closer to 0 deg C than to the cold start value,
currently 250 K).

In addition, this introduces a new namelist flag,
reset_dynbal_baselines, which allows the user to reset these baselines
at some desired point in the simulation. I think that, in general, this
resetting would break conservation. But as long as it is done before the
onset of transient glaciers, I think this should be okay. In this way,
the user can minimize dynbal fluxes even further, by resetting the
baselines after the system has spun up. If the states haven't changed
much from this point to the point when glacier dynamics occur, then the
dynbal fluxes should now be very small. (See the documentation of this
flag in namelist_definition_ctsm.xml for more details.)

Without this change, dynbal fluxes for a grid cell that undergoes 100%
glaciation / deglaciation in a single year are around 50 m ice, 1 m
liquid water, and a few tens of W m-2 (where those quantities of ice and
water are dribbled throughout the year, so we end up with an ice flux of
about 1.5e-6 mm/s throughout the year; and the energy flux is applied
evenly throughout the year - i.e., tens of W m-2 every time step for a
year). With this change, and with reset_dynbal_baselines set at an
appropriate time, these fluxes can be reduced to close to zero.

Answer changes

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: ALL, but different configurations show
      different levels of changes, as noted below
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      - new climate (at least regionally) for some configurations;
        roundoff for others: see below

    There are three levels of changes here:

    (1) For runs with transient glaciers, there are large answer changes
        in regions with changing glacier area. These answer changes are
        in the various dynbal fluxes - for liquid water and ice runoff,
        and for the dynbal sensible heat flux.

    (2) For runs with transient vegetation (Hist, Dv and Fates), there
        are roundoff-level changes in the dynbal fluxes. For liquid
        water and ice, these changes appear to only occur in grid cells
        where there is some glacier area (because now both the before
        and after gridcell water contents have changed by the same fixed
        amount, which changes the difference at the roundoff level). For
        heat, there are roundoff-level changes everywhere (because of
        changes in the order of operations).

    (3) All runs have large changes in the diagnostic variables,
        ICE_CONTENT1, LIQUID_CONTENT1 and HEAT_CONTENT1, over grid cells
        containing some glacier area.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

Purpose of changes
------------------

Two main changes (plus some small additional changes):

1. Removed / reworked some expensive tests

2. Interpolated all out-of-the-box initial conditions, so that the
   out-of-the-box version is now compatible with our current
   configuration. The changes from before were (a) our standard
   configuration now uses the gx1v7 rather than gx1v6 land mask; (b)
   many inactive points are now absent in memory.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all configurations that still need use_init_interp = .true.
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Not investigated carefully, but expected to be larger than roundoff/same climate

  Answers change for cases that still need to do interpolation from
  these out-of-the-box finidat files.

  I first confirmed that the new finidat files are good via:

  - Compared `ncdump -h` of old vs. new initial conditions files

  - Ran the following tests, with comparison against master; verified that
    these all pass and are bit-for-bit, that they use the new initial
    conditions files, and that they now have `use_init_interp` unset
    (whereas they used to have `use_init_interp` set to `.true.`); note
    that these cover 6 of the 7 new initial conditions files:

    ```
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm45BgcGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-default
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm45BgcCruGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-default
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm50Sp.cheyenne_intel.clm-default
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-ciso
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCropCru.cheyenne_intel.clm-ciso
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm50SpCru.cheyenne_intel.clm-default
    ```

  - To cover the last new initial conditions file, ran the following test
    (with the same checks as above: passes and bit-for-bit, checked
    finidat, and checked `use_init_interp`), with `./xmlchange
    LND_TUNING_MODE=clm5_0_cam6.0` (for the baseline for this test, I set
    `init_interp_method = 'use_finidat_areas'`, which I also used in
    interpolating this initial conditions file):
    
    ```
    SMS_Ld1.f09_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel
    ```

  Details on answer changes:

    As noted above, these changes are bit-for-bit for configurations
    that can now use the out-of-the-box initial conditions without
    interpolation. However, answers change for configurations that still
    require interpolation of the out-of-the-box initial conditions
    (e.g., because they are at a different resolution than the finidat
    file).

    I expected these answer changes around the Caspian Sea, due to the
    fact that we are now effectively interpolating twice from the
    original file: once to produce the new out-of-the-box file (which
    includes an interpolation from `gx1v6` to `gx1v7`, and so
    interpolates onto the Caspian Sea region) and once to go from
    `f09_g17` to the target resolution (rather than interpolating
    directly from `f09_g16` to the target resolution).

    However, when I ran a test with comparison to baselines -
    `ERP_Ld5.f19_g17.I1850Clm50Bgc.cheyenne_intel.clm-default` - I saw
    changes in regions further afield than simply around the Caspian
    Sea. See images in https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/pull/622 for
    details. It's possible that the other differences are also due to
    the Caspian Sea change, but it's also possible that there is some
    other cause here that I don't understand. But Erik Kluzek and I
    agreed that it isn't worth trying to understand these other
    (isolated) differences.

    Also note: While most f09_g17 tests are bit-for-bit with the earlier
    tag (because now use_init_interp is .false. for those tests),
    `SMS_Ld2_D.f09_g17.I1850Clm50BgcCropCmip6.cheyenne_intel.clm-basic_interp`
    differs in some glc forcing fields for a few grid cells in
    Antarctica. This is perhaps not surprising, since this test needs to
    use interpolation to get fields for the Antarctica virtual columns;
    so, while I don't completely understand the cause of these answer
    changes, I suspect the root cause is similar to the isolated answer
    changes I saw sprinkled around the world for
    `ERP_Ld5.f19_g17.I1850Clm50Bgc.cheyenne_intel.clm-default`.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

Initalization of time-varying `zwt`, `zwt_perched`, and `frost_table` are moved to `InitCold` in `SoilHydrologyType.F90`.

Previously, `zwt`, `zwt_perched`, and `frost_table` were initialized in `SoilHydrologyInitTimeConstMod.F90`, which caused confusions.

One-line Summary: History fields for vertically-resolved sums of soil C and N, and minor fixes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Main change is from Keith Oleson: Add history fields for
vertically-resolved sums of SOIL1C, SOIL2C, and SOIL3C for C12, C13,
C14, and similarly for N. New fields are SOILC_vr, C13_SOILC_vr, and
C14_SOILC_vr, and SOILN_vr. For runs that use the output_bgc usermods,
including cmip6 runs, we no longer output 'SOIL1C_vr', 'SOIL1N_vr',
'SOIL2C_vr', 'SOIL2N_vr', 'SOIL3C_vr', 'SOIL3N_vr'; instead we output
'SOILC_vr', 'SOILN_vr', and similarly for C isotopes.

Also minor fixes:
- Output cpl hist files in SSP test (resolves ESCOMP/ctsm#61)
- Remove FATES-related commented-out code in OzoneMod (this has been
  moved to https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/618)

One-line Summary: Set tracer version of irrigation fluxes

Purpose of changes
------------------

Set tracer version of irrigation fluxes.

This required a substantial rewrite of ApplyIrrigation (now renamed to
CalcIrrigationFluxes). The problem was that the code was written to
compute the total irrigation withdrawal from groundwater, then use this
to compute the application fluxes (drip/sprinkler), then later divide
this total withdrawal by layer. But for tracer fluxes to be computed
correctly, we needed to reorder this, so that the per-layer withdrawals
are determined before determining the application fluxes. This is
because the application flux needs to know the tracer concentrations of
the source, which requires knowing which layers the source is drawing
from. This was made more challenging because of the mix of patch-level
and column-level variables at play: irrigation demand is patch-level,
groundwater availability and extraction is column-level, but application
is back to patch-level.

In a somewhat-related change, I also reworked the passing of information
between soil hydrology (groundwater availability) and irrigation:
Previously, there was some near-duplicate code in
CalcAvailableUnconfinedAquifer (which was called prior to
ApplyIrrigation) and WithdrawGroundwaterIrrigation (which was called
after ApplyIrrigation). I have reworked the code to remove this
duplication, calling the new CalcIrrigWithdrawals in the midst of
CalcIrrigationFluxes. In doing so, I reconciled an accidental
discrepancy between the two original routines (see
https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/issues/595).

  Additional manual testing:

  - Out of the box, the one-timestep tracer consistency test
    (SMS_D_Ln1.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCropGs.hobart_nag.clm-tracer_consistency)
    passed when the new check was inserted after the irrigation call,
    even without the changes in this tag. Presumably this is because no
    irrigation was being done in the first time step of this test. To
    confirm that the changes here were both necessary and effective, I
    hacked the code to force irrigation of all types (surface and
    groundwater) on the first time step (see
    https://github.com/billsacks/ctsm/commit/d28a03145). I confirmed
    that this test, with those code hacks, failed before the changes in
    this tag, and passed with these changes in place.

  - I used a multi-step process to confirm that these changes are only

    looking greater-than-roundoff-level different from the baseline):

    (1) Confirmed that e507fe603 is only roundoff-level different from
        baseline using cprnc output from this test.

    (2) Confirmed that a4a1a626c is only roundoff-level different from
        e507fe603. This was the tricky part. I did this by introducing
        some temporary code that (a) computed some fluxes in both the
        old and new ways, (b) compared the old and new methods for each
        point and time step, confirming that they were no more than
        roundoff-level different, then (c) set the fluxes to the old
        method. I confirmed that this was bit-for-bit with e507fe603,
        and the checks for greater-than-roundoff-level differences
        between the old and new methods were never triggered. (See
        https://github.com/billsacks/ctsm/commit/7d23e9e and the earlier
        commits on that branch.)

    (3) Confirmed that remaining changes an the branch are bit-for-bit
        with a4a1a626c.

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:

      - Small answer changes when groundwater irrigation is enabled. In
        principle, could change answers by greater than roundoff due to
        fix of #595, but I didn't see any answer changes in my 7-month
        test due to that change. Other than that, just roundoff-level
        changes.

      - Answer changes when tracers are enabled.

      - Roundoff-level changes in the diagnostic field,
        QIRRIG_FROM_SURFACE, for many tests

    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate):

One-line Summary: Added tracer ratio capability and included it in consistency checks

Purpose of changes
------------------

These changes are needed to support the implementation of water isotopes by ensuring
that isotope-related variables are being updated consistently throughout the model.
The consistency checks include the testing of a bulk tracer that should always be
equal to the bulk, and also test tracers that maintain a fixed ratio (other than 
one) to the bulk.  This commit includes fixes to the cold start initialization for 
the water tracers with ratios other than one.

One-line Summary: New options for irrigation and crop fsat

Purpose of changes
------------------

Introduce three new options:

(1) Ability to withdraw irrigation water from groundwater if not enough
    water is available from rivers. This is controlled via new namelist
    flag, use_groundwater_irrigation. Water can be withdrawn from both
    the unconfined (from the soil column) and confined (from wa)
    aquifers.

(2) Irrigation method: sprinkler (above canopy) vs. drip (below
    canopy). This can be set on a per-crop and per-gridcell basis on the
    surface dataset, but out-of-the-box support for creating the
    necessary surface dataset field is not yet in place (see
    ESCOMP/ctsm#565). For now, it can be controlled globally via a new
    namelist flag, irrig_method_default. The default is drip, which was
    what we were previously using implicitly.

(3) Set crop fsat to zero. This is controlled by a new namelist option,
    crop_fsat_equals_zero.

Default behavior is the same as before for all three options.

Also:

- If use_aquifer_layer is false (which is the default for CLM50), no
  longer reset wa_col every time step

- Adds indices to vector history files giving column, landunit and
  gridcell indices for each patch, etc. (Resolves ESCOMP/ctsm#81:
  "Restart files are different for CLM when run over different number of
  tasks" (issue name is a misnomer of the remaining to-dos in that
  issue.)

- Writes 3d time-constant fields on first history file for all tapes,
  not just the first

- Small performance improvements to irrigation

Bugs fixed or introduced

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: ctsm1.0.dev019


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Some CLM50 cases that are either cold start
      or (unusually) use a CLM45 initial conditions file; it's possible
      that non-cold-start configurations would see differences rarely.
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Larger than roundoff, same climate

      Differences arise due to no longer resetting wa_col to
      aquifer_water_baseline every time step in BeginWaterBalanceSingle
      if use_aquifer_layer is false (which is the default for
      CLM50). (This change is needed to conserve water properly with the
      new groundwater-based irrigation.) For the most part, wa_col
      wasn't being changed when use_aquifer_layer is false (so no longer
      resetting it has no effect if groundwater irrigation isn't being
      used), but the one exception is the "work around of the negative
      liquid water" added by Jinyun Tang in subroutine SoilWater (dated
      Jan 14, 2015), which can be exercised when use_flexibleCN is
      true. Sean Swenson did some experimentation, and found that the
      code that updates wa_col is only exercised in the first time step
      of a cold start run, and that finding is borne out in the test
      suite results. However, it's possible that there are rare cases
      when this is exercised later in a run.

      I have confirmed that this branch is bit-for-bit with the baseline
      if I revert the addition of the use_aquifer_layer conditional
      around the wa_col resetting in
      BeginWaterBalanceSingle. Alternatively, nearly all tests are
      bit-for-bit with the baseline if I remove the one line updating
      wa_col in subroutine SoilWater (and also remove the endrun for
      water balance errors from BalanceCheck); the one exception is the
      waccmx_offline test, which uses a CLM45 initial conditions file in
      a CLM50 configuration.

      The following tests had baseline failures:

      Cold start tests:

         ERP_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.IHistClm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-allActive

One-line Summary: Rework cold start initialization of wa and zwt

Purpose of changes
------------------

Rework cold start initialization of wa and zwt when use_aquifer_layer is
false to reduce answer changes in upcoming groundwater_irrigation
branch.

In the groundwater_irrigation branch
(https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/pull/523), Sean Swenson has stopped
resetting wa_col each time step if use_aquifer_layer is false. However,
this leads to having a substantially different value of wa_col when
use_aquifer_layer is false: previously, it was reset to
aquifer_water_baseline each time step, but with Sean's changes, it stays
close to its initial values, which have been 4000 in most places. This
tag changes the initial values to match the value it was being reset to,
so it simply starts at aquifer_water_baseline - so the
every-time-step-resetting to aquifer_water_baseline can be removed
without massively changing the value of wa_col.

In addition to changing the cold start initialization of wa_col, we are
also changing the cold start initialization of zwt in this case where
use_aquifer_layer is false: The old initialization of zwt wouldn't work
as intended now that we have changed the initial value of wa_col; Sean
Swenson suggested this new initialization method instead. This
initialization to zi(c,nbedrock(c)) is correct if there are no saturated
layers, and close enough for a decent cold start even if there are.

One-line Summary: Water tracer updates for initial things in driver loop

Purpose of changes
------------------

Update water tracers for initial stuff done in driver loop. This includes
atm2lnd forcings (non-downscaled and downscaled), balance check initialization,
and dyn subgrid updates.

Broadly speaking, the changes here are:

(1) Reworked WaterType to make it easier / more robust for other code to loop
    over tracers or bulk+tracers

(2) The most interesting changes are probably the code to update the atm2lnd
    water tracers (in Wateratm2lndType.F90 and WaterTracerUtils.F90)

(3) In various other places, do some infrastructurey stuff (initializing water
    balance, doing dyn subgrid stuff) for tracers as well as bulk

(4) Supporting unit tests and unit test infrastructure

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- We have chosen not to set all water tracers as soon as possible, but instead
  to do these tracer settings later in the driver loop. This keeps the driver
  loop cleaner, but means that you cannot arbitrarily sprinkle calls to
  TracerConsistencyCheck throughout the driver. Specifically for this tag: the
  non-downscaled, gridcell-level atm2lnd water tracers are not updated until
  after the call to downscale_forcings, so tracer consistency checks before that
  point would fail.

One-line Summary: Merge the collapse2gencrop branch

Purpose of changes
------------------

These changes allow the model to not need to read 16-pft
datasets and rather read 78-pft datasets. The 78-pft datasets were
developed for use with prognostic crops originally. The current changes
allow the model to use the 78-pft datasets in 16-pft runs by
collapsing the crop pfts (cfts) from specific types to the model's
generic crop types. The changes are generic so that the model may still
read 16-pft datasets for 16-pft runs. Ultimately these changes will
permit users to run with any number of pfts, while the ctsm group
maintains a single set of input pft data.

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

   The "irrigate" attribute should now be removed from all fsurdat files for namelist generation.
   Thus irrigate on or off is now an option for non-crop cases.


Renamed parameters:
maxpatch_pft is obsolete; remove from namelist-related scripts in future PR

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All I compsets (except spinup test that uses cplhist datm forcing)
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Potentially new climate

  Changes answers for I compsets due to datm update as part of the cime
  update: new presaero and CO2 datasets
  (https://github.com/esmci/cime/pull/2828)

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: CMIP6 compset modifiers, usermods for typical output, and other output enhancements

Purpose of changes
------------------

(1) Support %BGC-CROP-CMIP6DECK and %BGC-CROP-CMIP6WACCMDECK compset
    modifiers, so that we can turn on the necessary options
    (output-related and others) via new CMIP6-specific compsets.

(2) Turn on carbon isotopes in CMIP6 runs (from Erik Kluzek)

(3) Remove setting of CCSM_BGC=CO2A in the cmip6 usermods

(4) Add usermods directories for getting typical extra output that's
    wanted in many cases: output_crop, output_crop_highfreq, output_bgc,
    output_bgc_highfreq, output_sp, and output_sp_highfreq. These can be
    enabled by adding something like '--user-mods-dir output_crop' on
    the create_newcase line (that short-hand works for an I compset; for
    F or B compsets, you need to provide the full path to the usermod
    directory).

(4) Allow holes in the number of history tapes. Holes are cases where,
    for example, we have h0, h1 and h3 tapes, but no h2 tape (because
    there are no fields on the h2 tape). (This is needed for (3).)

(5) Fix reading and writing of 1-d logical global arrays. This fixes
    ESCOMP/ctsm#24 for real (rather than just preventing an attempt to
    read/write 1-d logical arrays, as was done in the previous 'fix').

(6) Add C13_NBP and C14_NBP diagnostic fields (from Keith Oleson)

(7) Make a bunch of carbon isotope diagnostic fields inactive by default

(8) Don't allow interpolation (use_init_interp) from a case without
    carbon isotopes to a case with carbon isotopes: Due to
    https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/67, interpolation from a case
    without carbon isotopes to a case with carbon isotopes yields
    incorrect initialization values for the carbon isotopes. Now that
    we're turning carbon isotopes on via some semi-out-of-the-box
    usermods (for cmip6), it is becoming more important to check to make
    sure someone doesn't shoot themselves in the foot this way.

(9) Add tests of the new output usermods as well as of the CMIP6 compset
    modifiers

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Fixes #24 for real (ncd_io_1d_log_glob is broken)
- Fixes #529 (Organize usermods_dirs to facilitate running cases with
  the right output)

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): none

Changes to CTSM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
- New namelist variable, just for testing purposes:
  for_testing_allow_interp_non_ciso_to_ciso. This bypasses an error
  check, and should only be used in tests.

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): none

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): none

Substantial timing or memory changes: none

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in ../CTSMMasterChecklist as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): none

Changes to tests or testing:
- Reworked tests of cmip6_deck usermods to use the new
  %BGC-CROP-CMIP6DECK compset modifier, and changed f09_g16 to f09_g17
- Added a test of the %BGC-CROP-CMIP6WACCMDECK compset modifier
- Added tests of output_crop_highfreq, output_bgc_highfreq and
  output_sp_highfreq usermods directories
- Note that there are NO tests covering the cmip6_evolving_icesheet
  usermods: this usermod directory adds very little beyond cmip6_deck,
  so it didn't seem worth its own test

    comparisons. I reran it and it passed.

    Manually compared all history files from

    cheyenne_intel ---- ok
    cheyenne_gnu ------ ok
    hobart_nag -------- ok
    hobart_pgi -------- ok
    hobart_intel ------ ok

    ok means tests and baseline comparisons pass. There were unexpected
    NLCOMP diffs. From spot-checking a few tests, I see the following:

    
    (1) On both cheyenne and hobart: Diffs in logfile. This looks like a
        problem in cime: it says:

        BASE: logfile = 'rof.log.136342.hobart.cgd.ucar.edu
        COMP: logfile = 'rof.log

    (2) On hobart: Diffs in pio_typename: netcdf vs. pnetcdf (says that
        new uses pnetcdf): but when I compare files by hand, they look
        the same in this respect (both baseline and new use netcdf), so
        maybe this is due to a problem in the timing of when nlcomp is
        run?

    Since these both look like problems in the comparison script rather
    than in the tag, I'm letting these go, but will open a cime issue if
    we see this again.

One-line Summary: Fix the fact that transient Bgc and SP cases had constant crop area in time

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fix transient non-crop cases that had constant crop area so that crop area will change in time
(and hence natural veg area will also change corresponding to it).

Also bring in changes to update mksurfdata_map to handle SSP-RCP future scenarios. Right now
it can handle SSP5-8.5 out of the box. Also add a new test for that.

One-line Summary: Add snow-free fields for snowmip, fix several issues

Purpose of changes
------------------

Bring in new diagnostic fields added by Justin Perket, Sean Swenson and Mark Flanner
for Snow-MIP. Most of those are fields that represent "Snow Free" data.

Also bring in fixes for a list of issues. Add handling of the new CO2 which includes
both latitude-band and global average versions. Add some changes to make it easier
for input data processing including NOT doing the slow 1km map file creation. Have
the number of steps that are skipped at startup dependent on the time-step size. Add
a test for some requirements of WACCMX (time-step and use of ESMF). Calculations of 
local time are now done in a global subroutine, that can handle negative longitudes.
Fix how FFIX_TO_SMINN is handled for history output. The namelist logical "calc_human_stress_indices"
changed from logical to a character string of three values: FAST, NONE, ALL. FAST
is the default so the less expensive ones are output, NONE turns them all off, and ]
ALL does all of them including the expensive ones.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #428, #474, #475, #476, #450, #482, #481, #491
   Fix #428 -- Update getco2_historical.ncl to handle latitude varying CO2
   Fix #474 -- Add ability to send GRIDFILE to regridbatch.sh script
   Fix #475 -- Have number of steps to skip balance-check based on time
   Fix #476 -- Add a test for WACCMX standalone
   Fix #450 -- Add option to use global average of terrain standard deviation on surfdata files
       (partial fix with simplest option)
   Fix #482 -- Add extra field on CO2 streams file for global/time-averaged data
   Fix #481 -- FFIX_TO_SMINN needs to be output when FUN is on
   Fix #491 -- Calculations of local noon assume that longitude is 0 to 360 rather than -180 to 180

---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Be sure to review the steps in .CTSMTrunkChecklist as well as the coding style in the Developers Guide

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
   I was able to reduce the duplication in SurfaceAlbedoMod where the original implementation added a cut
   and paste copy of code. But, there is still a lot of duplication in this file that could be improved, by
   making smaller functions/subroutines to do sections of code that are essentially repeated many times.
   There's a bit of an increase in complexity to reduce the duplication, but reducing the duplication was worth it.

Changes to tests or testing:
   Add a new waccmx_offline test mods and test with it
   New test expected fail because of cime issue: ERS_D_Ln9_P480x3.f19_g16.I2000Clm50SpGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-waccmx_offline
   Turn use_ssre on for most tests, off for reducedOutput
   And set calc_human_stress_indices=NONE for reducedOutput, FAST for most, and ALL for KitchenSink and KSMOut tests

    not match the glacier area from CISM.)

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: ctsm1.0.dev006


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Startup / Hybrid runs that include CISM
     (even NOEVOLVE) and do not use init_interp, due to:
     - different PE layout in new case vs. the one that generated the
       finidat (roundoff-level diffs)
     - different glacier area on finidat file vs. what's in CISM
       (greater than roundoff-level diffs)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Roundoff-level for different PE layout, larger than roundoff but
      should be same climate when there is different glacier area on the
      finidat file vs. what's in CISM

      The differences arise from dynamic landunit adjustments of the
      below-ground C and N states in the old code, as CTSM adjusts its
      areas to match CISM's. In the new code, there are no C and N
      adjustments in the first time step from this adjustment.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Rework water data types to accommodate isotopes and other tracers

Purpose of changes
------------------

This tag reworks the various water data types to allow having multiple
instances of variables that are needed for isotopes and other water
tracers.

Specific changes include:

(1) Separated "water state" variables into state, diagnostic and balance
    check-related variables. This separation was not essential for the
    work here, but was desired by Martyn Clark and others.

(2) For each of water state, diagnostic and flux variables, separated
    variables into those needed for both bulk and tracers vs. those only
    needed for bulk. This way, we can have multiple instances of the
    variables needed by tracers, but only a single instance of variables
    that only apply to bulk water. This follows the design laid out in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395. The separation was based
    largely on what was done in the old water isotope branch; we didn't
    put a lot of thought into this, because the new design allows us to
    easily migrate variables between bulk-only and bulk-and-tracer as
    needed.

(3) Moved water fluxes that were defined in science modules back into
    waterflux_type or waterfluxbulk_type. This was needed for (2); there
    is more discussion on this in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395 and the log message for
    commit 711e5cd7.

(4) Introduced a top-level water_type that holds instances of all of the
    other water-related objects. This follows the design laid out in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395. This is particularly
    valuable for the tracer instances: the logic related to number of
    tracers can be encapsulated in water_type, rather than infiltrating
    clm_instMod.

(5) Added placeholders for water tracer instances

(6) Added infrastructure to generate history / restart field names for
    the tracer instances. Eventually, the isotope class can also hold
    information specific to each isotope.

This work was a joint effort between Mathew Rothstein and myself; Mat
gets much of the credit for the actual refactoring done here.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Fixes #358 (Separate WaterStateType into multiple types)
- Fixes #434 (Separate WaterFluxType into a base class and a class that just applies to bulk)
- Fixes #359 (Set up infrastructure for multiple instances of WaterState and WaterFlux types)
- Fixes #458 (Implement handling of history and restart variables for water tracers)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
- #464 (Some lines longer than 132 characters)
- #456 (Remove backwards compatibility check for snw_rds) (not a
  newly-introduced issue, but it's more important to fix this with the
  separation of waterstate_type)

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

- Whether to use water tracers and which water tracers to use are
  currently hard-coded; eventually, this should be namelist-controlled

Code reviewed by: Mathew Rothstein and Bill Sacks worked together on
these changes and reviewed each other's changes to some extent. The
high-level design was also reviewed and co-developed by Mariana
Vertenstein. Martyn Clark contributed substantially to the breakout of
water state into state, diagnostic and balance check-related variables.

One-line Summary: Fix NFIX flux variables so special land-units are zeroed out, tools update, add some *_MAX fields on mksurfdata_map for transient cases

Purpose of changes
------------------

Nitrogen Fixation flux arrays were being set to missing value over non-vegetated landunits. This sets them to zero everywhere
and averages in the zero's at the gridcell level for history output. It also reads in restarts with missing values and converts
them to zero's.

There are also some tools updates, getting the tools working on the new upgraded hobart.cgd.ucar.edu.

And mksurfdata_map is updated to add some *_MAX files on the landuse.timeseries files that will allow us to conserve memory
for transient cases.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

One-line Summary: Begin separating SoilHydrology flux calculations

Note the new tag naming: Starting with this tag, we are naming tags
"ctsm..." rather than "clm...". We are starting with ctsm version 1,
which for now is nearly the same as clm version 5. We are moving to this
new tag naming now because:

(1) The changes in this tag represent the first step towards
    implementing the CTSM vision (separating the biogeophysics flux
    calculations from state updates, making it easier to plug in
    alternative parameterizations, etc.).

(2) This tag changes answers relative to the CLM5 release. (We expect
    the climate to be the same, but we haven't tested this carefully
    yet.)

Purpose of changes
------------------

First steps toward separating various flux calculations in the soil
hydrology code. The focus here is on saturated surface runoff and
infiltration excess runoff. The changes here separate flux calculations
from state updates and extract various calculations into their own
subroutines to facilitate swapping in alternative parameterizations.

Most of the changes here are refactorings that are either bit-for-bit or
just introduce roundoff-level differences. However, there are also a few
larger answer changes, as described below.

These are the greater-than-roundoff-level answer changes:

(A1) Use full qflx_surf in BGC code. Previously, the subroutines ch4 and
     SoilBiogeochemNLeaching had been using a flux that excluded surface
     water runoff (qflx_h2osfc_surf). That was deemed to be incorrect
     (by Dave Lawrence and others), so these BGC subroutines have been
     changed to use the full surface runoff (saturated excess runoff +
     infiltration excess runoff + h2osfc runoff).

     Configurations affected: BGC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; expected to be same
     climate, but not investigated carefully

(A2) VIC: Don't ever use the TOPModel formulation for SurfaceRunoff

     The code was using the TOPModel-based formulation for SurfaceRunoff
     if frost_table > zwt_perched. Sean Swenson felt this shouldn't be
     done, and refactoring will be easier if VIC always uses the
     vic-looking formulation, so I'm stopping applying this formulation
     when using VIC.

     Configurations affected: VIC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; not investigated carefully

(A3) VIC: Remove infiltration excess runoff

     Martyn Clark reviewed the VIC implementation, and felt that the
     current implementation of infiltration excess runoff is
     inconsistent with the standard VIC implementation. It appears that
     what was being called VIC's infiltration excess runoff was actually
     just an attempt to give a better numerical approximation to the
     solution for saturated surface excess runoff. So deleting this
     leaves only a first-order approximation to VIC's saturated surface
     excess runoff.

     Eventually we may want to put in place a more accurate solution for
     VIC's saturated surface excess runoff. But Martyn's feeling is that
     this can come in with other changes we want to make regarding
     numerical solutions in CTSM.

     Configurations affected: VIC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; expected to be same
     climate, but not investigated carefully

(A4) Change in QOVER diagnostic field: now includes QH2OSFC.

These are the major refactorings (either bit-for-bit or just
roundoff-level differences):

(R1) Extract surface runoff to its own module, and other modularization
     related to what used to be subroutine SurfaceRunoff: extract a
     subroutine for each fsat method, move urban surface runoff code
     into different routines.

(R2) Extract infiltration excess runoff to its own module, and other
     modularization related to what used to be subroutine Infiltration.

NOTE: For a detailed breakdown of changes, including documentation of
which changed changed answers, see the file ChangeLog_branch which was
deleted from this branch shortly before it was merged to master.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Shortened a 25-month f19 test to 13-months
  (SMS_Lm13.f19_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput):
  This test took a long time to run, and we already have long tests of
  this configuration at coarse-resolution. I suggested removing this
  test entirely, but Erik Kluzek wanted to maintain a shortened version
  of it. Erik's comments were:

     How about either flip it to f45 (because Rosie is using that
     resolution for science) -- or leave it at f19 and have it run for 9
     months? The 25 months was to take it just past the 2-year spinup
     time. From spunup initial conditions 9-months pretty much does a
     full harvest cycle. f19 and f09 are the main configurations for
     science and it would be good to have something longer than just
     really short tests.

  I decided on Lm13, because this still completes in significantly less
  than 2-hours, and if we're running for 9 months anyway, it seems
  valuable to finish out the year and run a bit into the next year,
  since some crop stuff triggers at the end of the year.

Code reviewed by: Various code reviews done last Fall, when these
changes were first implemented.
