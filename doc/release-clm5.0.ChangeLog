One-line Summary: Some answer changes needed for prescribed soil-moisture and clm4_5 defaults (1850-ndep, and urbantv settings)

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Some answer changes needed for prescribed soil-moisture. And clm4_5 defaults for 1850 Nitrogen deposition and or urbantv
settings were made to be consistent with clm5_0.


CTSM Master Tag This Corresponds To: ctsm1.0.dev025 (with many other changes)

Summary of changes:
-------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): #175, #817, #832 #833

   Fixes #817 -- Have clm4_5 use the same ndep file as clm5_0 for 1850
   Fixes #175 -- Have clm4_5 use the same settings for urbantv years as clm5_0
   Fixes #832 -- don't override with missing value, let the model set it
   Fixes #833 -- time interpolation of soilm causes bad values for some missing points

Science changes since: release-clm5.0.28

   Defaults for clm4_5, prescribed soil-moisture

   Some defaults were changed for clm4_5 to be consistent with clm5_0 (use of the same 1850-ndep file, 
   and changes in the urbantv year settings)

   Prescribed soil-moisture was changes so that if time-interpolation produces large values, they
   will be marked as missing (spval). Also points where the input prescribed soil moisture is missing
   are now ignored (and run normally).

Software changes since:  release-clm5.0.28


Changes to User Interface since: release-clm5.0.28

  Behavior of soilm_ignore_data_if_missing changes!

  Behavior of soilm_ignore_data_if_missing changes. Now if true will ignore any points
  where the prescribed soil moisture dataset is missing. So for these points the model
  will run normally (as if prescribed soil moisture was off). Before it would mark them
  as missing, but modify h2osoi_ice/liq in an odd fashion.

One-line Summary: Several bit-for-bit fixes especially around soil-moisture streams

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

A list of several bit-for-bit fixes. Some very minor and other's more extensive.

mksurfdata_map was extended so that when you specify vegetation types, you can let it use the natural and crop coverage
from the input datasets. This allows you to for example run a global simulation with all vegetation types in every grid cell.
This can be useful in seeing what types of vegetation grow in each grid cell. Also simplify some of the logic that allowed
for old format PFT datasets that didn't include crop information. Since, we don't have or need to work with such datasets
this complex logic could be removed. Also added some new unit tests for mksurfdata and the defining PFT values.

Add time interpolation alogrithm type to most of the stream files, so it can be changed via namelist. Add historical data to the
Nitrogen deposition future scenario datasets.

Add namelist control variables for soilm_offset, and tint_algo for most of the streams. tint_algo allows you to control the time
interpolation and change it to a simpler one (like upper) in order to show that the streams output agrees with the streams data
input. soilm_offset allows the user to change the time-stamp offset if the time-stamp isn't at the middle of averaging interval.
This is important for the soil moisture streams for a case where you want to use the output of a CTSM simulation for soil-moisture
as normally the time-stamp is the end of the interval (so you could use -1296000 to roughly compensate for the time-stamps to be
at the end of the month rather than mid-month). Add a namelist item to continue when soil moisture is prescribed and a gridpoint
is missing on the input streams file, but required for the simulation running. Also add an optional history field H2OSOI_PRESCRIBED_GRC
that corresponds to the input soil moisture streams, so you can ensure the prescribe soil moisture is working correctly and agrees
with the input dataset.

Fix the threading bug for soil-moisture and LAI streams. This is done by adding a new "advance" subroutine that does the streams
advance part of the calculation in a non-OpenMP area of the CLM driver, while the "interp" subroutine remains in the Open-MP 
loop.

Include missing prescribed testmods directory. Allow branches with use_init_interp=T with a log message about it. 
Move tests from hobart to izumi.

This is bit-for-bit

One-line Summary: Add presoribed soil moisture streams as an option, and a few fixes

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Add new prescribed moisture streams feature from Sean Swenson. This allows the user
to specify a steams file for soil moisture and use it in place of the model prognostically
determining soil moisture. To turn it on set use_soil_moisture_streams=T. You can also 
set the filename to use with stream_fldfilename_soilm, and there are other _soilm namelist
items to control the years to run over. The file MUST be on the same grid as the model resolution.

Update 0.125x0.125 mapping and surfdata data, and fix hirespft data issues. Update cime 
with SSP1-2.6 presaero data. So now can run the SSP1-2.6 CMIP6 future scenario.
Update rtm release branch to rtm1_0_69, which brings in a fix for cold starts.

Move mksurfdata changes from ctsm1.0.dev053 over, which fixes a rare soil color bug.

One-line Summary: Add a CN precision control call to fix problems related to small negative values

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Small negative values (roughly roundoff-level different from zero) in
frootc (and possibly other quantities) were occasionally creating
problems with carbon isotope fluxes and FPI in the first time step of
the year, at the time of transient landcover change. This tag fixes the
problem by introducing an extra call to SoilBiogeochemPrecisionControl
in between computing the patch-level transient landcover fluxes and
moving these to column-level. In particular, this truncates small
negative values of decomp_cpools_vr_col to zero, which prevents the
previous blow-ups.

For most of the problematic fields, the explanation seems to be: frootc
can sometimes be negative; this is intentional. Negative frootc causes
negative dwt_frootc_to_litter if the patch in question is shrinking. The
resulting negative fluxes cause problems in the ciso calculation. This
can be worked around by inserting an extra precision control call
between the calculation of the dwt fluxes and the ciso fluxes, so that
small negative dwt fluxes are set to 0.

This does not necessarily fully explain the issue with FPI, but the
insertion of the extra precision control call fixes that issue, too.

https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/741

Summary of Answer changes:
-------------------------

If the tag used for baseline comparisons was NOT the previous tag, note that here: previous

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Transient cases and a few other
      configurations as noted below
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Larger than roundoff / same climate

      According to Keith Oleson's analysis of the LMWG diagnostics:
      Changes are possibly greater than roundoff-level, but are not
      climate changing or scientifically meaningful.

      Other than transient cases (including cases with transient glacier
      area as well as those with transient natural vegetation / crop
      area), the test suite showed differences in the following cases:

      - Two present-day tests that specify changes in soil layer
        structure
        (ERI_D_Ld9.ne30_g16.I2000Clm50BgcCruGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-vrtlay
        and
        ERS_D_Ld3.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCruGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-deepsoil_bedrock),
        have changes in many fields (for the latter: mostly looks
        roundoff-level, but a few greater than roundoff-level diffs)

      - The present-day ciso test,
        ERP_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCruGs.cheyenne_gnu.clm-ciso_flexCN_FUN,
        has changes in a few c13 and c14 fields

      - There are changes in many fields in SSP tests

      - ERP_D_P36x2_Ld3.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCruGs.cheyenne_intel.clm-noFUN_flexCN
        (and a similar test on hobart) have roundoff-level changes in
        SMINN_vr, SMIN_NH4_vr and SMIN_NO3_vr

One-line Summary: Change two files from NetCDF-4 format to NetCDF-3 (because some machines have trouble with NetCDF-4 in pnetcdf)

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

There are two files in NetCDF-4 format that the model uses. Copy these files to NetCDF-3 classic format and point
to the new version in the CLM XML database (use nccopy -k classic). There are some machines that have trouble with
reading NetCDF-4 files in pnetcdf.

There are still some NetCDF-4 files for mksurfdata_map, but some of these are required to be in NetCDF-4 format. And we only
support mksurfdata_map and mkmapdata on cheyenne.

One-line Summary: Correct ndep end year for SSPs, 2-degree CMIP6WACCMDECK with C-isotopes off, fixes mksurfdata for high resolution

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Fix a couple small issues. Correct end year for ndep for SSP's so can run to the end of 2100. Some fixes to mksurfdata_map for high
resolution surface datasets. Have 2-degree WACCM-CMIP6DECK match a user-mod directory without carbon isotopes on. Remove the
ne120np4 and conus_30_x8 surface dataset files, as they can't be used (see #673).

Remove 8x16, 32x64 resolutions as they are no longer needed and there are problems with them. Add in the mapping files needed for
94x192. Check that special landunit percent area's is not less than 0.0, and don't let PCT_WET be less than zero for areas with
ocean (see #673).

Change some of the longer single point tests to use Qian forcing (as faster, less memory, less problems). Add compsets for this.
This change was also done on master.

One-line Summary: Update cime to bring in CO2 transient files for the CMIP6 SSP's as well as presaero for three of them

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

With updated cime with transient CO2 for all CMIP6 SSP scenarios and prescribed aerosol files for three of
the CMIP6 SSP scenarios (SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5). Previously all SSP scenaros would run, and use the
closest SSP nitrogen deposition file, now only the ones that are available work (Tier I). Also CLM4.5 used
the old CMIP5 ndep files, and now they use the CMIP6 ones available.

Fix some small issues with some of the tools

One-line Summary: Fix carbon isotope bug that caused wrong answers for isotopes under transient land-use change

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

We currently have a bug so that for transient land-use change cases answers are different starting in soil
carbon when Carbon isotopes (use_c13, or use_c14) are on versus off. Answers are identical if there is no
land-use change. The bug does cause bulk Carbon (C12) to be slightly different, but qualitatively the same.
There is a significant impact to the Carbon isotope simulation however. The bug was causing changes in isotopic
pools to be directed to the bulk Carbon. Because, isotopes are so much smaller than bulk Carbon, this doesn't 
cause a marked difference in the bulk Carbon simulation. But, the lack of the change in the isotopic pool
does have a meaningful impact on the simulation of the Carbon isotopic fields.

One-line Summary: New ndep files, update fates, fix some issues

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

New nitrogen deposition files for future scenarios: SSP245 and SSP370. And now points
to the closest reasonable new CMIP6 SSP ndep file that we have (for clm50, clm45 points
to the old RCP files).

Update FATES to s1.21.0.a7.0.0. Which brings in a list of improvements and bug fixes. New
options include fates-hydro and fates-parteh

Point to all of the available CO2 files, so we can convert them for use by datm.

Bring in new high resolution PFT land-mask SCRIP grid file (MODISv2), as a start to get the -hirespft
option to work in mksrfdata.pl. Mapping files still need to be created.

Add a test that turning on Carbon isotopes does NOT change answers (currently triggered because of #667)

One-line Summary: History fields for vertically-resolved sums of soil C and N, and minor fixes

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Main change is from Keith Oleson: Add history fields for
vertically-resolved sums of SOIL1C, SOIL2C, and SOIL3C for C12, C13,
C14, and similarly for N. New fields are SOILC_vr, C13_SOILC_vr, and
C14_SOILC_vr, and SOILN_vr. For runs that use the output_bgc usermods,
including cmip6 runs, we no longer output 'SOIL1C_vr', 'SOIL1N_vr',
'SOIL2C_vr', 'SOIL2N_vr', 'SOIL3C_vr', 'SOIL3N_vr'; instead we output
'SOILC_vr', 'SOILN_vr', and similarly for C isotopes.

Also minor fixes:
- Output cpl hist files in SSP test (resolves ESCOMP/ctsm#61)
- Remove FATES-related commented-out code in OzoneMod (this has been
  moved to https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/618)
- Minor tweak to run_sys_tests

One-line Summary: Option for rain-to-snow to immediately run off in some regions

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Up until now: When repartition_rain_snow is .true. (which is the default
for CLM5), rain that falls when the near-surface temperature is cold is
converted to snow. This repartitioning was put in place for two
reasons: (1) Downscaling to elevation classes: changing the balance
between rain and snow for different elevation classes; (2) Correcting
problems in CAM. However, members of the Land Ice Working Group would
like to change this behavior so that, when CAM produces cold-temperature
rain, this rain immediately runs off rather than being converted to
snow. The purpose of this is to reduce the too-high SMB over portions of
Greenland in CESM2 coupled runs (which results in part from CAM's
generation of liquid precipitation despite very cold temperatures).

This new behavior is implemented in a glacier region-specific manner,
based on a new namelist flag, glacier_region_rain_to_snow_behavior. It
is not at all ideal to make this aspect of the physics differ by region,
but this has been requested by members of the Land Ice Working Group in
order to address biases over Greenland while having minimal impact on
the climate (so that the climate can stay very similar to that of the
official CMIP6 runs). Note that, unlike other glacier region-specific
behaviors, this one applies to all landunits, not just glaciers. This
also seems a bit non-ideal, but we want the physics to be the same for
all landunit types in a given region, and we also want this behavior to
apply to vegetated columns because they are used for glacial
inception (and we want this alternate behavior to apply to glacial
inception, too, in order to decrease some instances of inception).

The justification for this new physics is: In the case of (1) above: If
CAM is generating rain at a given elevation / temperature, that doesn't
necessarily imply that an equal water equivalent of snow would be
generated at a higher elevation / lower temperature: indeed, in reality,
there might not be any precipitation falling at that higher elevation /
lower temperature. In the case of (2) above: There seem to be problems
with CAM's microphysics that cause it to produce too much rain when
temperatures are very cold; it seems (at least to some people) equally
justifiable to throw this cold rain away (by sending it to the ocean as
runoff) as it is to convert this cold rain to snow.

Note: I don't think any changes are needed in
BalanceCheck (unfortunately), since BalanceCheck currently uses the
post-downscaling precipitation fluxes, and the pre-lnd2atm runoff
fluxes (i.e., the new runoff flux isn't included in the terms in
BalanceCheck, and it doesn't need to be because BalanceCheck uses the
post-downscaling precipitation fluxes). (See also
https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/201#issuecomment-444264954 .)

CTSM Master Tag This Corresponds To: N/A

   At least for now, we are bringing this to the release branch but not to
   master. Here is an excerpt from the email explaining this rationale:

   My question is: Should I do this:

   (1) Just on a branch off of the release-clm5.0 branch, with no plan to
       bring it back to release-clm5.0 or master

   (2) On the release-clm5.0 branch, but not bring it back to master

   (3) On the release-clm5.0 branch and master

   My inclination right now is towards (2). I don't really like (1) because
   this change will be wanted for a number of CMIP6-related experiments,
   and it feels like it could be a pain to keep this branch up-to-date with
   the evolving release-clm5.0 branch. However, the changes are going to be
   a bit messy and having this be region-specific isn't really physically
   justifiable (it's just being done that way to keep the climate as close
   as possible to the official CMIP6 runs), so I'm not sure we really want
   this on master. If we did anything on master, I could imagine having a
   globally-applicable switch controlling this behavior, rather than having
   it apply to just certain glacier regions.

   Bette: The main reason I could see for bringing this to master is if you
   imagine needing to use this new option in isotope-enabled runs, since
   the isotope-enabled version of CTSM won't be on the release-clm5.0
   branch. Do you think it's likely that you'd need to do that, or would
   the isotope-enabled runs use the standard CMIP6 physics settings in this
   respect?

One-line Summary: New IC files for clm45/clm50 coupled cases, add 2010 compset

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Improve logic for picking initial condition files (finidat). Add new finidat files
for when coupled to CAM (LND_TUNING_MODE=clm*_cam6.0) for both 1850 (from CMIP6 B1850 case)
and 2000/2010 (from CMIP6 BHIST case).

Logic for picking finidat files now will pick a finidat file that it interpolates from
provided the default settings allow use_init_interp to be true. This makes it more likely
to pick a file to startup from if at all possible, rather than dying with an error that
a finidat couldn't be found (which the user could override to get the new behavior by adding
use_init_interp=T to their user_nl_clm).

In namelist settings for finding finidat files for sim_yr=2000, be explict on which tuning mode
is being matched and duplicate the clm4_5/clm5_0 GSWP3v1/CRUv7 matches. This gets it to match
the correct ones and allows them to be distinquished in the future.

Added CLM_NML_USE_CASE=2010_control, and settings for sim_yr=2010, which is needed for some new CAM compsets.

One-line Summary: Bring in CMIP6 compset modifiers, output usermods and bit-for-bit fixes from dev014 and dev015

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Bring in all changes from ctsm1.0.dev014 and ctsm1.0.dev015:

From ctsm1.0.dev015:

(1) Support %BGC-CROP-CMIP6DECK and %BGC-CROP-CMIP6WACCMDECK compset
    modifiers, so that we can turn on the necessary options
    (output-related and others) via new CMIP6-specific compsets.

(2) Turn on carbon isotopes in CMIP6 runs (from Erik Kluzek)

(3) Remove setting of CCSM_BGC=CO2A in the cmip6 usermods

(4) Add usermods directories for getting typical extra output that's
    wanted in many cases: output_crop, output_crop_highfreq, output_bgc,
    output_bgc_highfreq, output_sp, and output_sp_highfreq. These can be
    enabled by adding something like '--user-mods-dir output_crop' on
    the create_newcase line (that short-hand works for an I compset; for
    F or B compsets, you need to provide the full path to the usermod
    directory).

(4) Allow holes in the number of history tapes. Holes are cases where,
    for example, we have h0, h1 and h3 tapes, but no h2 tape (because
    there are no fields on the h2 tape). (This is needed for (3).)

(5) Fix reading and writing of 1-d logical global arrays. This fixes
    ESCOMP/ctsm#24 for real (rather than just preventing an attempt to
    read/write 1-d logical arrays, as was done in the previous 'fix').

(6) Add C13_NBP and C14_NBP diagnostic fields (from Keith Oleson)

(7) Make a bunch of carbon isotope diagnostic fields inactive by default

(8) Don't allow interpolation (use_init_interp) from a case without
    carbon isotopes to a case with carbon isotopes: Due to
    https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/67, interpolation from a case
    without carbon isotopes to a case with carbon isotopes yields
    incorrect initialization values for the carbon isotopes. Now that
    we're turning carbon isotopes on via some semi-out-of-the-box
    usermods (for cmip6), it is becoming more important to check to make
    sure someone doesn't shoot themselves in the foot this way.

(9) Add tests of the new output usermods as well as of the CMIP6 compset
    modifiers

From ctsm1.0.dev014: Four miscellaneous minor, bit-for-bit bug fixes:

(1) Py3 pylint check and address cime issue ESMCI/cime#2822 (from Jim
    Edwards: ESCOMP/ctsm#526)

(2) Change uppercase DEBUG variables to lowercase debug (requested by
    Jim Edwards to avoid conflicting with the DEBUG CPP token)
    (Fixes ESCOMP/ctsm#534)

(3) Remove unnecessary line of code in LunaMod.F90 that was causing
    problems with some compilers due to an uninitialized variable
    (Fixes ESCOMP/ctsm#322)

(4) Add r8 to 0 constant to fix build issue with XLF compiler (from Jim
    Edwards: ESCOMP/ctsm#531)

One-line Summary: Bring in bit-for-bit changes from master up to ctsm1.0.dev012: AnnEt init, snowmip fields

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Bring in new diagnostic fields added by Justin Perket, Sean Swenson and Mark Flanner
for Snow-MIP. Most of those are fields that represent "Snow Free" data.

Also bring in fixes for a list of issues. Add handling of the new CO2 which includes
both latitude-band and global average versions. Add some changes to make it easier
for input data processing including NOT doing the slow 1km map file creation. Have
the number of steps that are skipped at startup dependent on the time-step size. Add
a test for some requirements of WACCMX (time-step and use of ESMF). Calculations of
local time are now done in a global subroutine, that can handle negative longitudes.
Fix how FFIX_TO_SMINN is handled for history output. The namelist logical "calc_human_stress_indices"
changed from logical to a character string of three values: FAST, NONE, ALL. FAST
is the default so the less expensive ones are output, NONE turns them all off, and ]
ALL does all of them including the expensive ones.

InitAccVars was mistakenly setting qflx_evap_tot_col rather than
AnnET. This fix allows us to remove now-redundant cold start and restart
code for AnnET.

CTSM Master Tag This Corresponds To: ctsm1.0.dev012

Summary of changes:
-------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): 
  Fix #428 -- Update getco2_historical.ncl to handle latitude varying CO2
  Fix #474 -- Add ability to send GRIDFILE to regridbatch.sh script
  Fix #475 -- Have number of steps to skip balance-check based on time
  Fix #476 -- Add a test for WACCMX standalone
  Fix #450 -- Add option to use global average of terrain standard deviation on surfdata files
  (partial fix with simplest option)
  Fix #482 -- Add extra field on CO2 streams file for global/time-averaged data
  Fix #481 -- FFIX_TO_SMINN needs to be output when FUN is on
  Fix #491 -- Calculations of local noon assume that longitude is 0 to 360 rather than -180 to 180
  Fix #480 InitAccVars for AnnET initializing the wrong variable
  Fix #285 Remove an un-needed restart variable (partially)

One-line Summary: Updated CMIP6 ndep file for historical transient Bgc cases, 1850_control same as before

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Update the ndep file for transient cases for CLM50 to the CMIP6 version that has identical
data for 1849-1850 to the previous CMIP6 1850_control (with different mid-month times however), and
new 3-member ensemble average/5-year smoothing from the WACCM case: b.e21.BWHIST.f09_g17.CMIP6-historical-WACCM.00[123].
The new data is monthly rather than yearly, which means there will be a seasonal cycle to nitrogen deposition
for transient cases now. The midmonth times/dates are different for the multi-year file from
the previous file, so answers change when using it for 1850_control cases even though the data is exactly the same.
Because, of that we are still pointing to the previous 1850 CMIP6 ndep file.

CLM4.5 is still using the previous CMIP5 ndep dataset.

Update cime and cism so can work on upgraded hobart. Also fix an issue that the Nag6.2 compiler found
in CTSM. Also get working with glade changes that happened on cheyenne, DIN_LOC_ROOT_CLMFORC was
changed to a new directory.

Nitrogen Fixation flux arrays were being set to missing value over non-vegetated landunits. This sets them to zero everywhere
and averages in the zero's at the gridcell level for history output. It also reads in restarts with missing values and converts
them to zero's.

There are also some tools updates, getting the tools working on the new upgraded hobart.cgd.ucar.edu.

And mksurfdata_map is updated to add some *_MAX files on the landuse.timeseries files that will allow us to conserve memory
for transient cases.

One-line Summary: Second release branch tag for CESM2.0 release, fixing DA and tools and README files, identical to clm5.0.dev013

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Update cime and cism to newer versions used in release. These bring in some answer
changes. The cime version updates the orbit for 2000 compsets. The cism version
changes answers for two fields with NO_EVOLVE and more fields for EVOLVE.

Fixes an important bug needed for use with Data Assimulation. Several changes
to testing. Adding wallclock as needed, changing a few compsets so science
supported compsets are used, added tput_tolerance to some tests known to be
variable.

Many changes to the clm tools for creating input files. Added the version by
querying "git describe" and adding it as an attribute to NetCDF files. Changes
to get tools working, and tested. Also changed so that tools can be run in either
a CTSM checkout or a CESM checkout.

Updated README files so they are accurate.

One-line Summary: First release branch tag for CESM2.0 release, identical to clm5.0.dev012

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

This is the first release branch tag for the CESM2.0 release for CTSM. There are many changes
to software mostly to fix a list of issues. There are some changes to the science that change
answers to fix some small problems, but don't have a large effect on simulations. Externals are
updated to new versions, fixing issues, and in most cases changing answers. The cime version
was updated and brings in some new features.

One-line Summary: Initial version of CLM5.0

This is the initial science version of CLM5.0.

Developments for CLM5.0 build on the progress made in CLM4.5. Most major components of the model have been updated with particularly
notable changes made to soil and plant hydrology, snow density, river modeling, carbon and nitrogen cycling and coupling, and crop
modeling.
The updates to CLM science are documented here:

https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Introduction/CLM50_Tech_Note_Introduction.html#clm5-0

This version has production versions of CLM5.0 CMIP6 land-use change files for 1850, historical, and 2000. It has preliminary
versions of CMIP6 forcing files for Nitrogen deposition and population density. Further updates are needed for prescribed aerosols,
and future scenarios.

Spunup initial conditions are provided for several CLM physics and forcing combinations from simulations run at 1-degree resolution
(fv 0.9x1.25 with g1xv6 ocean mask).
