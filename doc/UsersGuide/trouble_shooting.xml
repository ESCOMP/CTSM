<title>Trouble Shooting Problems</title>
<para>
In this chapter we give some guidance on what to do when you encounter some of the
most common problems. We can't cover all the problems that a user could potentially 
have, but we will try to help you recognize some of the most common situations.
And we'll give you some suggestions on how to approach the problem to come up with
a solution.
</para>
<para>
In general you will run into one of three type of problems:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>configure-time</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>build-time</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>run-time</emphasis></para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
You may also run into problems with <command>create_newcase</command> itself, or
with the archiving scripts -- for those problems you should consult the 
<ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;cesm">&cesm1; Scripts User's Guide</ulink>.
</para>

<sect1 id="trouble_w_configure">
<title>Trouble with Configuration</title>
<para>
The first type of problem happens when you invoke the <command>configure -case</command>
command. This indicates there is something wrong with your template files, or input
datasets, or the details of what you are trying to configure the model to do.
There's also a trouble-shooting chapter in the <ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;cesm">&cesm1;
Scripts User's Guide</ulink>. Many of the problems with configuration can be resolved
with the guidelines given there. Here we will restrict ourselves to problems from the
&clm; or datm templates or input files.

</screen>
</example>
The important thing to note here is the line:
<screen width="99">
ERROR: generate_resolved.csh error for lnd template
</screen>
which tells us that the problem is in the land template. It may also indicate problems
in one of the other templates (atm, ccsm, cpl, glc, ice, or ocn), in which case you 
should consult the appropriate model user's guide, and examine the given template file
in <filename>Tools/Templates</filename>. For more information on working with template
files see <xref linkend="editing_templates"></xref>.
</para>
<para>
In the example above, it's obvious that the problem is coming from the &clm; &buildnml;,
in other situations it might not be so obvious where the problem is occurring. In such
cases it might be useful to add a "set echo" command to the top of the template file so
that each command in the template will be echoed to the screen and you can see what 
is happening and where the error is occurring.
<screen width="99">
set echo
</screen>
</para>
<para>
In the example, the error is that the &clm; XML database does NOT have a
<filename>fpftdyn</filename> for the given resolution and ocean mask. That means you
will need to create the file and then supply the file into your case. See
<xref linkend="tools"></xref> for more information on creating files, and see
<xref linkend="adding_files"></xref> for more information on adding files to the 
XML database. Alternatively, you can provide the file to your case by creating
a user namelist as shown in <xref linkend="config_time_nml"></xref>.
</para>

<para>
The two most common problems from your &clm; template will be errors from the &clm;

<title>Trouble with Running</title>
<para>
Tracking down problems while the model is running is much more difficult to do
than configure or build problems. In this section we will give some suggestions
on how to find run time problems. Below we show the log file results of a job
that aborted while running.

In the next section we will talk about using the different log files to track
down problems, and find out where the problem is coming from. In the section
after that we give some general advice on debugging problems and some suggestions
on ideas that may be helpful to track the problem down. Some of the examples
below are from the <ulink url="../KnownBugs">KnownBugs</ulink> file.
</para>
<sect2 id="querying_log_files">
<title>Tracking Problems by Querying Log Files</title>
<para>
The first thing to do when tracking down problems is to query the different log
files to see if you can discover where the problem occurs, and any error messages about
it. It's important to figure out if the problem comes in at initialization or in the
run phase of the model, and in which model component the problem happens. There
are different log files for the different major components, and they all end 
with the date and time in YYMMDD-HHMMSS format (2-digit: year, month, day, hour
minute and second). When the model runs to completion the log files will be copied
to the <filename>logs</filename> directory in the script directory, but when the
model fails they will remain in the run directory. Here's an example list of
log files from an "I" case where the model dies in the land model initialization.
For "I" cases the sea-ice and ocean components are just stubs and don't create
log files (and unless running with the active land-ice model "glc" log files won't
be created either).

<sect3 id="cpl_log">

The first log file to check is the coupler log file so that you can see where
the model dies and which model component it fails in. When the model dies at
initialization the last model component listed is the component that failed.

<sect3 id="ccsm_log">
<title>The ccsm log file</title>
<para>
The ccsm log files are to some extent the "garbage collection" of log output. The
clm sends it's output from it's master processor, but sends other output and possibly
errors to the ccsm log file. Because, of this, often error messages are somewhere in the
ccsm log file. However, since there is so much other output it may be difficult to find.
For example, here is some output where the RTM river routing file was not provided and
the error on the open statement for the file was embedded near the end of the ccsm log
file.

<sect3 id="clm_log">
<title>The clm log file</title>

Of course when you are working with and making changes to clm, most of your focus
will be on the clm log file and the errors it shows. As already pointed out 
if you don't see errors in the <filename>lnd.log.*</filename> file you should look
in the <filename>ccsm.log.*</filename> to see if any errors showed up there.

The names of the batch log files will depend on the batch system of the machine
that is being used. They will normally be in the script directory. Usually, they
don't contain important information, but they are a last resort place to look for
error messages. On the NCAR IBM system "bluefire" the batch files are called
with names that start with "poe" and then either "stderr" or "stdout", with the
job number at the end.

<sect2 id="gen_adv_dbg_runtime">
<title>General Advice on Debugging Run time Problems</title>
<para>
Here are some suggestions on how to track down a problem while running. In general
if the problem still occurs for a simpler case, it will be easier to track down.
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Run in DEBUG mode</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Run with a smaller set of processors</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Run in serial mode with a single processor</emphasis></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis>Run a simpler case</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Run with a debugger</emphasis></para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<sect3 id="debug_mode">
<title>Run in DEBUG mode</title>
<para>
The first thing to try is to run in DEBUG mode so that float point trapping will be 
triggered as well as array bounds checking and other things the compiler can turn
on to help you find problems. To do this edit the &envbuild; file and set <envar>DEBUG
</envar> to <literal>TRUE</literal> as follows:
<screen width="99">
> xmlchange -file env_build.xml -id DEBUG -val TRUE
</screen>
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="fewer_pes">
<title>Run with a smaller set of processors</title>
<para>
Another way to simplify the system is to run with a smaller set of processors. You
will need to clean the configure and edit the <filename>env_mach_pes.xml</filename>.
For example, to run with four processors:
<screen width="99">
> configure -cleanall
> xmlchange -file env_mach_pes.xml -id NTASKS_ATM -val 4
> xmlchange -file env_mach_pes.xml -id NTASKS_LND -val 4
> xmlchange -file env_mach_pes.xml -id NTASKS_ICE -val 4
> xmlchange -file env_mach_pes.xml -id NTASKS_OCN -val 4
> xmlchange -file env_mach_pes.xml -id NTASKS_CPL -val 4
> xmlchange -file env_mach_pes.xml -id NTASKS_GLC -val 4
> configure -case
</screen>
Another recommended simplification is to run without threading, so set the
<envar>NTHRDS</envar> for each component to "1" if it isn't already. Sometimes,
multiprocessing problems require a certain number of processors before they occur
so you may not be able to debug the problem without enough processors. But, it's always
good to reduce it to as low a number as possible to make it simpler. For threading
problems you may have to have threading enabled to find the problem, but you can run
with 1, 2, or 3 threads to see what happens.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="run_serially">
<title>Run in serial mode with a single processor</title>
<para>
Simplifying to one processor removes all multi-processing problems and makes
the case as simple as possible. If you can enable <envar>USE_MPI_SERIAL</envar>
you will also be able to run interactively rather than having to submit to a job
queue, which sometimes makes it easier to run and debug. If you can use 
<envar>USE_MPI_SERIAL</envar> you can also use threading, but still run interactively
in order to use more processors to make it faster if needed.
<screen width="99">
> configure -cleanall
# Set tasks and threads for each component to 1
# You could also set threads to something > 1 for speed, but still
# run interactively if threading isn't an issue.

</sect3>

<sect3 id="lower_res">
<title>Run at a lower resolution</title>
<para>
If you can create a new case running at a lower resolution and replicate the problem
it may be easier to solve. This of course requires creating a whole new case, and trying
out different lower resolutions.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="simpler_case">
<title>Run a simpler case</title>
<para>
Along the same lines, you might try running a simpler case, trying another compset
with a simpler setup and see if you can replicate the problem and then debug from that 
simpler case. Again, of course you will need to create new cases to do this.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="dbx">
<title>Run with a debugger</title>
<para>
Another suggestion is to run the model with a debugger such as: <command>dbx</command>,
<command>gdb</command>, or <command>totalview</command>. Often to run with a debugger
you will need to reduce the number of processors as outlined above. Some debuggers such
as <command>dbx</command> will only work with one processor, while more advanced
debuggers such as <command>totalview</command> can work with both MPI tasks and OMP
threads. Even simple debuggers though can be used to query core files, to see where
the code was at when it died (for example using the <command>where</command> in 
<command>dbx</command> for a core file can be very helpful. For help in running
with a debugger you will need to contact your system administrators for the machine
you are running on.
