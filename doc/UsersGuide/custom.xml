<title>How to customize the configuration for a case with &clm;</title>

<para>
The <ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;cesm">
&cesm; User's Guide</ulink> gives you the details on how to setup, &configure;, build, and run
a case. That is the document to give you the details on using the &cesm; scripts. The purpose 
of this document is to give you the details when using &cesm; with &clm; on how to customize
and use advanced features in &clm;. You should be familiar with the &cesm; User's Guide and
how to setup cases with &cesmrel; before referring to this document.
</para>
<para>
In this chapter we deal with three different ways of customizing a case: Choosing a compset,
Customizing Configuration options, and customizing the &clm; Namelist. There are many different
compsets that use &clm; and many are setup to enable special features of &clm; from the start. So
the first thing you want to be familiar with are the different options in the compsets. The 
next section shows the different options for customizing the configuration options for
&clm;.
Here we introduce the &clm; &configure; and &buildnml; scripts and how using the options in
&envconf; you can customize the configuration and the initial
namelist. The final section tells you about the &clm; namelist and how you can customize the
namelist once you have run "&configure; -case" and have an initial namelist in
<filename>BuildConf/clm.buildnml.csh</filename>. You can also 
use &envconf; options to change your namelist as well, before "&configure; -case" is
run.

<title>Choosing a compset using &clm;</title>

<para>
When setting up a new case one of the first choices to make is which "component
set" (or compset) to use. The
compset refers to which component models are used as well as specific settings for them. We label the different
types of compsets with a different letter of the alphabet from "A" (for all data model) to "X" (for all dead model).
The compsets of interest when working with &clm; are the "I" compsets (which contain
&clm; with a data atmosphere model
and a stub ocean, and stub sea-ice models), "E" and "F" compsets (which contain &clm;
with the active atmosphere model (<acronym>CAM</acronym>),
prescribed sea-ice model, and a data ocean model), and "B" compsets which have all active components. Below we
go into details on the "I" compsets which emphasize &clm; as the only active model, and just mention the two other categories.
</para>
<para>
When working with &clm; you usually want to start with a relevant "I" compset before moving to the more
complex cases that involve other active model components. The "I" compsets can exercise
&clm; in a way that
is similar to the coupled modes, but with much lower computational cost and faster turnaround times.

<title>Customizing the &clm; configuration</title>
<para>
The "Creating a Case" section of the 
<ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;cesm">&cesm1; Scripts
User's-Guide</ulink>
gives instructions on creating a case. What is of interest here is how to customize your
use of &clm;
for the case that you created. In this section we discuss how to customize your case before the first
step -- the "&configure; -case" step is done. In the next section we will discuss how to customize your
&clm; namelist after "&configure; -case" has already been done.
</para>
<para>
For &clm; when "&configure; -case" is called there are two steps that take place:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The &clm; "&configure;" script is called to setup the build-time
configuration for &clm; (more information on &configure; is given in
<xref linkend="clm_configure_script"></xref>).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The &clm; "&buildnml;" script is called to generate  the initial
run-time namelist for &clm; (more information on &buildnml; is given below in
<xref linkend="nl_def"></xref>.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
When customizing your case at the &configure; step you are able to modify the process by effecting either one
or both of these steps. The &clm; "&configure;" and "&buildnml;" scripts are both available in the "models/lnd/clm/bld" 
directory in the distribution. Both of these scripts have a "-help" option that is useful to examine to see what
types of options you can give either of them.
</para>
<para>
There are five different types of customization for the configuration that we will 
discuss: &cesm1;  &clm; configuration items, Configure time User Namelist,
other noteworthy &cesm;  configuration items, the &clm; &configure; script options, and 
the &clm; &buildnml; script options.
</para>
<para>
Information on all of the script, configuration, build and run items is found under 
<filename>scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template</filename>

<para>
<anchor id="CLMCONFIG"></anchor>
The option &CLMCONFIG; is all about passing command line arguments to the &clm; &configure; script. It is important
to note that some compsets, may already put a value into the &CLMCONFIG; variable. You can still add more
options to your &CLMCONFIG; but make sure you add to what is already there rather than replacing it. Hence,
it may be best to edit the &envconf; file to do this rather than use the xmlchange script. In
<xref linkend="clm_configure_script"></xref>
below we will go into more details on options that can be customized in the &clm; "&configure;" script. It's
also important to note that the &clm; template may already invoke certain &clm; &configure; options and as such those
command line options are NOT going to be available to change at this step (nor would you want to change them).
The options to &configure; are given with the "-help" option which is given in

&CLMUSECASE; is used to set a particular set of conditions that set multiple namelist items, all centering around
a particular usage of the model.
To list the valid options do the following:

The option &CLMBLDNML; is for passing options to the &clm; "&buildnml;" script. As with the "&configure;"
script the &clm; template may already invoke certain options and as such those options will NOT be available to be
set here. The best way to see what options can be sent to the "&buildnml;" script is to do

<para>
The &clm; template already sets the resolution and mask as well as the &configure; file,
the start-type, and defines an input
namelist and namelist input file, and it normally sets either "-ignore_ic_year" or "-ignore_ic_date". Also many
of the options are designed solely for &clm; stand-alone testing and hence should NOT be used (any of the options starting
with a "datm_" or "drv_" prefix. Hence there are then only four different options that could be set:

<para>
"-lnd_res" is used to run &clm; in fine-mesh mode at a higher resolution than the atmospheric model. This can
be useful to get higher resolution from the land model, but saving computer time
by running the more expensive atmospheric model at a lower resolution. 
To get a list of valid resolutions to run at do the following:
</para>
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc
> ../bld/&buildnml; -lnd_res list
</screen>
<caution>
<para>
The fine-mesh mode is considered experimental, and you may run into problems when you use
it. Another option is to use the CESM level "tri-grid" capability to run the land model
on a different grid than the atmospheric model. Read the CESM User's-Guide to learn how
to do this.
</para>
</caution>
<para>
"-clm_demand" asks the &buildnml; step to require that the list of variables
entered be set. Typically, this is used to require that optional filenames be used and ensure
they are set before continuing. For example, you may want to require that
<varname>fpftdyn</varname> be set to get dynamically changing vegetation types. To do this
you would do the following.
<screen width="99">
> ./xmlchange -file env_conf.xml -id &CLMBLDNML; -val "-clm_demand fpftdyn"
</screen>
To see a list of valid variables that you could set do this:
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc
> ../bld/&buildnml; -clm_demand list
</screen>
</para>
<note>
 <para>
Using a 20th-Century transient compset or the <envar>20thC_transient</envar> use-case
using &CLMUSECASE; would set this as well, but would also use 
dynamic nitrogen and aerosol deposition files, so using <envar>-clm_demand</envar> would be a way 
to get <emphasis>just</emphasis> dynamic vegetation types and NOT the other files as well.
</para>
</note>
<para>
"-sim_year" is used to set the simulation year you want the data-sets to simulate conditions for in the input
datasets. The simulation "year" can also be a range of years in order to do simulations
with changes in the dataset values as the simulation progresses. To list the valid 
options do the following:
</para>
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc
> ../bld/&buildnml; -sim_year list

<para>
"-rcp" is used to set the representative concentration pathway for the future scenarios
you want the data-sets to simulate conditions for, in the input
datasets. To list the valid options do the following:

The option &CLMNAMELIST; is for passing namelist items into the "clm_inparm" namelist.
Any items that are set in &CLMNAMELIST; will be set in your namelist after "&configure;
-case" is done.
</para>
<important>
<para>
For character namelist items you need to use "&amp;apos;" as quotes for strings so that the 
scripts don't get confused with other quotes they use.

Example, you want to set <varname>hist_dov2xy</varname> to <varname>.false.</varname>
so that you get vector output to your history files. To do so edit
&envconf; and add a setting for <varname>hist_dov2xy</varname>.

what the names will need to be. For example if your &CLMUSRDAT; will 
be "1x1_boulderCO", with a "navy" land-mask, constant simulation year range, for 1850,

<title>Configure time User Namelist</title>
<para>
&CLMNAMELIST; as described above allows you to set any
extra namelist items you would like to appear in your namelist after first &configure;d.
However, it only allows you a single line to enter namelist items, and strings must
be quoted with &amp;apos; which is a bit awkward. If you have a long list of namelist
items you want to set (such as a long list of history fields) a convenient way to do it
is to create a &usernlclm; that contains just the list of namelist
variables you want to add to your initial namelist. The &usernlclm;
will only be used when &configure; is run, so if you change it after &configure; -- it won't
change anything. The file needs to be in valid FORTRAN namelist format, and the &configure;
step will abort if there are syntax errors. It merely needs to be named correctly
&usernlclm; and placed in your case directory (where your other
<filename>env_*.xml</filename> files are). The namelist name actually doesn't have to be
valid, but all the variable names must be. Here's an example &usernlclm;
namelist that sets a bunch of history file related items, to create output history files
monthly, daily, every six and 1 hours.

<para>
In the above example we use an invalid namelist name &amp;clmexp -- but it works anyway
because the CLM &buildnml; knows the namelist that specific variable names belong to, and
it puts them there.

Obviously, all of this would be difficult to put in the &CLMNAMELIST;
variable, especially having to put &amp;apos; around all the character strings. For

The final thing that the user may wish to do before &configure; is run is to edit

to edit the template. But, there are rare instances where it is useful to do so.

namelist variables remove given history fieldnames from history file auxiliary "streams".
A history "stream" is a set of history files that are produced at a given frequency.
By default there is only one stream of monthly data files. To add more streams you
add history fieldnames to <varname>hist_fincl2</varname> through
<varname>hist_fincl6</varname>. The output frequency and the way averaging is done
can be different for each history file stream. By default the primary history files
are monthly and any others are daily. You can have up to six active history streams, but you need
to activate them in order. So if you activate stream "6" by setting
<varname>hist_fincl6</varname>, but if any of <varname>hist_fincl2</varname> through
<varname>hist_fincl5</varname> are unset, only the history streams up to the first blank one

The frequency of the history file streams is given by the namelist variable

following values have the given meaning:

<title>Removing all history fields</title>
<para>
Sometimes for various reasons you want to remove all the history fields either
because you want to do testing without any output, or you only want a very small
custom list of output fields rather than the default extensive list of fields.
By default only the primary history files are active, so technically using
<varname>hist_fexcl1</varname> explained in the first example, you could list 
<emphasis>ALL</emphasis> of the history fields that are output in 
<varname>hist_fexcl1</varname> and then you wouldn't get any output. However, as
the list is very extensive this would be a cumbersome thing to do. So to facilitate
this <varname>hist_empty_htapes</varname> allows you to turn off all default output.
You can still use <varname>hist_fincl1</varname> to turn your own list of fields
on, but you then start from a clean slate. 
A sample user namelist &usernlclm; turning off all history 
fields and then activating just a few selected fields (ground and vegetation temperatures
and absorbed solar radiation) is:
<example>
<title>Example &usernlclm; namelist removing all history fields</title>

<sect3 id="hist_averaging">
<title>Various ways to change history output averaging flags</title>
<para>
There are two ways to change the averaging of output history fields. The first is using
<varname>hist_avgflag_pertape</varname> which gives a default value for each history
stream, the second is when you add fields using <varname>hist_fincl*</varname>, you add
an averaging flag to the end of the field name after a colon (for example 'TSOI:X', would
output the maximum of TSOI).
The types of averaging that can be done are:
<simplelist>
<member><emphasis>A</emphasis> Average, over the output interval.</member>
<member><emphasis>I</emphasis> Instantaneous, output the value at the output interval.</member>
<member><emphasis>X</emphasis> Maximum, over the output interval.</member>
<member><emphasis>M</emphasis> Minimum, over the output interval.</member>
</simplelist>

The default averaging depends on the specific fields, but for most fields is an average.
A sample user namelist &usernlclm; making the monthly output
fields all averages (except TSOI for the first two streams and FIRE for the 5th stream), 
and adding auxiliary file streams for instantaneous (6-hourly), 
maximum (daily), minimum (daily), and average (daily). For some of the fields we
diverge from the per-tape value given and customize to some different type of 
optimization.

<para>
In the example we put the same list of fields on each of the tapes: soil-temperature,
ground temperature, vegetation temperature, emitted longwave radiation, reflected
solar radiation, sensible heat, total latent-heat, and total water storage. We also
modify the soil-temperature for the primary and secondary auxiliary tapes by outputting
them for a maximum instead of the prescribed per-tape of average and instantaneous
respectively. For the tertiary auxiliary tape we output ground temperature instantaneous
instead of as a maximum, and for the fourth auxiliary tape we output vegetation
temperature instantaneous instead of as a minimum. Finally, for the fifth auxiliary
tapes we output <varname>FIRE</varname> instantaneously instead of as an average.
</para>

<note>
<para>
We also use <varname>hist_empty_htapes</varname> as in the previous example,
so we can list ONLY the fields that we want on the primary history tapes.

<sect3 id="hist_vector">
<title>Outputting history files as a vector in order to analyze
the plant function types within gridcells</title>
<para>
By default the output to history files are the grid-cell average of all land-units, and
vegetation types within that grid-cell, and output is on the
full 2D latitude/longitude grid with ocean masked out. Sometimes it's important to
understand how different land-units or vegetation types are acting within a grid-cell.
The way to do this is to output history files as a 1D-vector of all land-units and vegetation
types. In order to display this, you'll need to do extensive post-processing to make sense
of the output. Often you may only be interested in a few points, so once you figure out the
1D indices for the grid-cells of interest, you can easily view that data. 1D vector output
can also be useful for single point datasets, since it's then obvious that all data is for the
same grid cell.
</para>
<para>
To do this you use <varname>hist_dov2xy</varname> which is an array of rank six for 
each history stream. Set it to
<varname>.false.</varname> if you want one of the history streams to be a 1D vector. 
You can also use <varname>hist_type1d_pertape</varname> if you want to average over all the:
Plant-Function-Types, columns, land-units, or grid-cells.
A sample user namelist &usernlclm; leaving the primary monthly
files as 2D, and then doing grid-cell (GRID), column (COLS), 
and no averaging over auxiliary tapes output daily for a single field 
(ground temperature) is:

Technically the default for <varname>hist_nhtfrq</varname> is for primary files
output monthly and the other auxiliary tapes for daily, so we don't actually have
to include <varname>hist_nhtfrq</varname>, we could use the default for it. Here
we specify it for clarity.
</para>
</note>
<caution>
<para>
Visualizing global 1D vector files will take effort. You'll probably want
to do some post-processing and possibly just extract out single points of interest
to see what is going on. Since, the output is a 1D vector, of only land-points
traditional plots won't be helpful. The number of points per grid-cell will also
vary for anything, but grid-cell averaging. You'll need to use the output fields
<varname>pfts1d_ixy</varname>, and <varname>pfts1d_jxy</varname>, to get the mapping
of the fields to the global 2D array. <varname>pfts1d_itype_veg</varname> gives you 
the PFT number for each PFT. Most likely you'll want to do this analysis in a 
data processing tool (such as NCL, Matlab, Mathmatica, IDL, etcetera that is able
to read and process &netcdf; data files).
