One-line Summary: Remove infiltration excess runoff for VIC

Purpose of changes
------------------

Martyn Clark reviewed the VIC implementation, and felt that the current
implementation of infiltration excess runoff is inconsistent with the
standard VIC implementation. It appears that what was being called VIC's
infiltration excess runoff was actually just an attempt to give a better
numerical approximation to the solution for saturated surface excess
runoff. So deleting this leaves only a first-order approximation to
VIC's saturated surface excess runoff.

Eventually we may want to put in place a more accurate solution for
VIC's saturated surface excess runoff. But Martyn's feeling is that this
can come in with other changes we want to make regarding numerical
solutions in CTSM.

One-line Summary: Truncate small h2osfc values to zero

Purpose of changes
------------------

This replaces the earlier code that only did this truncation in one
particular circumstance.

This seems mainly important to truncate small negative numbers to 0, but
it also seems like a good idea to truncate small positive numbers that
should have been 0.

With some intermediate commits on this branch, I did some careful tests
to ensure that these diffs introduce no more than roundoff-level
changes.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all clm45/clm50
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

      I introduced some temporary code to ensure that, where there are
      differences between the old and new code, these differences are
      only roundoff-level (e.g., a roundoff-level value being rounded to
      0 now where it wasn't before).

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new

One-line Summary: Finish Infiltration modularization - mainly h2osfc updates

Purpose of changes
------------------

Finish the modularization of subroutine Infiltration. The main focus here is
modularizing the calculation of fluxes out of h2osfc and the updates of the
h2osfc state variable. Flux calculations and state updates are now done
separately. Where a flux calculation depends on a partially-updated version of
h2osfc, this is now made explicit in a way that could facilitate removing this
partial update later.

One-line Summary: Rename things related to saturated surface runoff

Purpose of changes
------------------

Renames the module, derived type, variables and methods related to saturated
surface runoff. The rename qflx_sat_surf -> qflx_sat_excess_surf was suggested
at a ctsm meeting. The other renames are to be consistent with that and
consistent with InfiltrationExcessRunoffMod.

Also, remove a long yellowstone test, change PE count for cheyenne: Removing
this long test that sometimes exceeds the 2-hour limit I give it (other times it
takes just slightly less than 2 hours):
ERS_Ly5_P60x1.f10_f10_musgs.IHistClm50BgcCrop.yellowstone_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput. We
still have an identical test on cheyenne. Also, increase the PE count on
cheyenne to use two full nodes, rather than a partial node.

One-line Summary: Modularization of Infiltration - first stage

Purpose of changes
------------------

Separate out the first 3 steps of subroutine Infiltration into more modular
homes. The biggest piece of this is to introduce a new
InfiltrationExcessRunoffMod.F90; this will be where alternative
parameterizations of infiltration excess runoff can be put.

    NOTE: Most tests were run on 24913d0. On the final commit (afdbcf7), I ran
    only the following tests:

    These test failed without the fix in afdbcf7, so I reran them with that fix:

      ERP_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.yellowstone_intel.clm-allActive

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: unified_land_model_n02_clm4_5_16_r249


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      roundoff

      There are greater than roundoff-level changes in the diagnostic field
      QOVER, because this field now includes QH2OSFC. Other than that, there are
      just roundoff-level differences in runoff. Sometimes, these roundoff-level
      runoff changes can feed back to create greater-than-roundoff level changes
      over time. This happens for ch4-related fields, and for many fields in
      this test with flooding:
          ERP_P180x2_D.f19_g17.I2000Clm50SpRtmFl.yellowstone_pgi.clm-default

      Note that the oldhyd test is bit-for-bit:
          SMS_D_Ld1_P24x1.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm45BgcCrop.hobart_nag.clm-oldhyd

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: If using VIC, don't use the TOPModel formulation for SurfaceRunoff ever

Purpose of changes
------------------

The code was using the TOPModel-based formulation for SurfaceRunoff if
frost_table > zwt_perched. Sean Swenson felt this shouldn't be done, and
refactoring will be easier if VIC always uses the vic-looking formulation, so
I'm stopping applying this formulation when using VIC.

    For baseline comparisons, just spot-checked one test:

    This test changed answers

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Vic configurations
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      larger than roundoff; not investigated closely

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A
