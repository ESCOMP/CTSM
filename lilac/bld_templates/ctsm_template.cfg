# Values with FILL_THIS_IN *must* be specified. Values with UNSET should
# generally be specified explicitly, but it's also acceptable to leave
# these as UNSET and use the out-of-the-box defaults.
#
# Note that some other files also need to be set in lilac_in:
# atm_mesh_filename and lnd_mesh_filename

# rather than using one of the out-of-the-box ones.

# configuration: 'nwp' or 'clm'
#
# This controls a number of physics options that differ between the
# standard numerical weather prediction (nwp) and climate (clm)
# configurations of CTSM. These are typically options that are
# computationally expensive. These include plant hydraulic stress and
# the MEGAN chemistry model (both of which are on by default for clm but
# off by default for nwp).
configuration     = nwp

# structure: 'fast' or 'standard'
#
# This controls various aspects of CTSM's subgrid and vertical layer
# structure. Typically, 'fast' is used for high-resolution NWP
# applications and 'standard' is used for lower-resolution climate
# applications. Parameters changed by this variable include number of
# soil and snow layers and how much subgrid variability is allowed in
# each grid cell. This also controls the maximum number of iterations in
# some iterative solution schemes - again, trading off speed for
# accuracy.
