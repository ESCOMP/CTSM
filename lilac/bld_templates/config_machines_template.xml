<!-- This is a partial cime machine port which should be able to get
     through the case.build step. Trying to get further than that will
     cause problems, because various directory paths won't be set up
     properly.

     If you are looking at the template file: Variable names prefixed
     with a dollar sign will be replaced with machine-specific values. A
     double dollar sign gets replaced with a single dollar sign, so
     something like $$MYVAR refers to the MYVAR cime variable.
