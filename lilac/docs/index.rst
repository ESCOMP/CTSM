LILAC: Lightweight Infrastructure for Land Atmosphere Coupling
==============================================================

LILAC is a new coupling interface for the Community Terrestrial Systems Model
(CTSM). It provides a high-level Fortran API for coupling CTSM to atmospheric
models such as the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. LILAC makes
extensive use of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).
