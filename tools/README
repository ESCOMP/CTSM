$CTSMROOT/tools/README					Dec/05/2023

IMPORTANT NOTE: Normally tools for creating input datasets for CLM
such as surface dataset creation would be here. As well as post processing
or other utility side line tools. However, we are only supporting
tools for later versions of the code. The tools should all work to create
or process datasets from these versions.

Therefore if you need any tools here checkout:

ctsm5.1.dev158 or later and use it

Let us know if you run into issues here by posting to the CESM Forum
or sending email to ctsm-software@ucar.edu
