===================
Build Requirements:
===================

mksurfdata_esmf is a distributed memory parallel program (using Message Passing
Interface -- MPI) that utilizes
both ESMF (Earth System Modelling Framework) for regridding as well as Parallel
I/O (PIO) and NetCDF output. As
such libraries must be built for the following:

1) MPI
2) NetCDF
3) PIO
4) ESMF

In addition for the build: python, bash-shell, CMake and GNU-Make are required

These libraries need to be built such that they can all work together in the same executable. Hence, the above
order may be required in building them.

=========================================
Use cime to manage the build requirements
=========================================

For users working on cime machines you can use the build
script to build the tool for you. On other machines you'll need to do a port to cime
and tell how to build for that machine. That's talked about in the cime documentation.
And you'll have to make some modifications to the build script.

https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/wiki/Porting-Overview

Machines that already run CTSM or CESM have been ported to cime. So if you can run the model
on your machine you will be able to build the tool there.

To get a list of the machines that have been ported to cime: 

cd ../../cime/scripts  # assumes we are in tools/mksurfdata_esmf
./query_config --machines

NOTE:
In addition to having a port to cime, the machine also needs to have PIO built and able
to be referenced with the env variable PIO which will need to be in the porting instructions
for the machine. Currently an independent PIO library is not available on cime ported machines.

=======================
building the executable (working in tools/mksurfdata_esmf)
=======================

> ./gen_mksurfdata_build.sh      # For machines with a cime build
# Note: The pio_iotype value gets set and written to a simple .txt file
# by this build script. The value depends on your machine. If not running
# on cheyenne, casper, izumi, or hobart, you may need to update this, though
# a default value does get set for other machines.

=======================
running for a single submission:
=======================
# to generate your target namelist:
> ./gen_mksurfdata_namelist.py --help
# for example try --res 1.9x2.5 --start-year 1850 --end-year 1850:
> ./gen_mksurfdata_namelist.py --res <resolution> --start-year <year1> --end-year <year2>
# IF FILES ARE MISSING FROM /inputdata, a target namelist will be generated
# but with a generic name and with warning to run ./download_input_data next.
# IF A SMALLER SET OF FILES IS STILL MISSING AFTER RUNNING ./download_input_data
# and rerunning ./gen_mksurfdata_namelist.py, then rerun
# ./gen_mksurfdata_namelist.py with --vic selected (and iteratively additional
# options if still necessary) and rerun ./download_input_data until
# ./gen_mksurfdata_namelist.py finds all files.

# to generate your target jobscript (again --help for instructions):
> ./gen_mksurfdata_jobscript_single.py --number-of-nodes 24 --tasks-per-node 12 --namelist-file target.namelist
> qsub mksurfdata_jobscript_single

=======================
running for the generation of multiple datasets
=======================
# Note that gen_mksurfdata_jobscript_multi.py runs ./gen_mksurfdata_namelist.py
> ./gen_mksurfdata_jobscript_multi.py --help
> ./gen_mksurfdata_jobscript_multi.py --number-of-nodes 24 --tasks-per-node 12 --scenario all
> qsub mksurfdata_jobscript_multi

------------------------------------------------------------
slevis HAS RUN THESE CASES and HAS LISTED ISSUES ENCOUNTERED
------------------------------------------------------------
REMEMBER TO compare against existing fsurdat files in
/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/lnd/clm2/surfdata_map/release-clm5.0.18
1) Soil color & texture and ag fire peak month outputs too high in .log
   TODO? Change frac_o from always 1.
2) Pct lake has chged in the .log bc the old diagnostic omitted mask_i frac_o
3) Slope, stddev have chged in the .log bc the old diag. used frac_o
4) 1x1_brazil min number-of-nodes tested: 4; 10x15 min tested: 3

------------------------------------------------------
NOT ALL FILES HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED to cdf5 : check last millenium
------------------------------------------------------
> nccopy -k cdf5 oldfile newfile

--------------------------------------------------------
Override options removed that need to be placed in fsurdat_modifier
and/or subset_data:
--------------------------------------------------------
--soil_clay --soil_sand for setting to these values everywhere
--all_urban = .true.
Normalize so that sum(urban_classes_o(n,:)) = 100 for all n, even for grid
cells where pcturb_o(n) = 0 (in the case where pcturb_o(n) = 0, come up with an
arbitrary assignment of urban into the different classes).
See comments in the normalize_urbn_by_tot subroutine for how urban_classes_o is
determined when the total % urban is 0, according to the input data.
