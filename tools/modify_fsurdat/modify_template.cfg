[modify_input]

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .cfg file with inputs for fsurdat_modifier.
#
# We advise users to make a copy of this file that they can change freely,
# rather than changing this "template" file.
#
# Variables with FILL_THIS_IN must be specified.
# Variables with UNSET may be specified; if not and
# - idealized = False, they will remain unused
# - idealized = True, they will take on default values hardwired in the
# code. Details in comments below.
# Variables with values already set, may be changed to other values. If
# they get omitted, they will obtain the same default values found in
# modify_template.cfg.

# idealized (bool)
# When user wants existing values in fsurdat to persist in all except the
# variables that they explicitly request to change, then set this to False.
# When user wants idealized representation of the land by resetting all
# fsurdat variables, some through this file and others by using hardwired
# defaults, then set this to True. Hardwired values are as follows:
# zbedrock = 10
# SLOPE = 0
# PFTDATA_MASK = 1
# LANDFRAC_PFT = 1
# PCT_NATVEG = 100  other landunits 0
# PCT_SAND = 43  corresponds to loam
# PCT_CLAY = 18  corresponds to loam
# ORGANIC = 0

# Boundaries of user-defined rectangle (float)
# If lat_1 > lat_2, the code creates two rectangles, one in the north and
# one in the south.
# If lon_1 > lon_2, the rectangle wraps around the 0-degree meridian.
# Alternatively, user may specify a custom area in a .nc landmask_file
# below. If set, this will override the lat/lon settings.

# (bare soil). Valid values range from 0 to a max value (int) that one can
# obtain from the fsurdat_in file using ncdump (or method preferred by user).
# The max valid value will equal (lsmpft - 1) and will also equal the last
# value of cft(cft).
