SYNOPSIS 

     For supported resolutions:
     mksurfdata.pl -res <res>  [OPTIONS]
        -res [or -r] "resolution" is the supported resolution(s) to use for files (by default usrspec ).

      
     For unsupported, user-specified resolutions:	
     mksurfdata.pl -res usrspec -usr_gname <user_gname> -usr_gdate <user_gdate>  [OPTIONS]
        -usr_gname "user_gname"    User resolution name to find grid file with 
                                   (only used if -res is set to 'usrspec')
        -usr_gdate "user_gdate"    User map date to find mapping files with
                                   (only used if -res is set to 'usrspec')
                                   NOTE: all mapping files are assumed to be in mkmapdata
                                    - and the user needs to have invoked mkmapdata in 
                                      that directory first
        -usr_mapdir "mapdirectory" Directory where the user-supplied mapping files are
                                   Default: ../mkmapdata

OPTIONS
     NOTE: The three critical options are (-years, -glc_nec, and -ssp_rcp) they are marked as such.

     -allownofile                  Allow the script to run even if one of the input files
                                   does NOT exist.
     -dinlc [or -l]                Enter the directory location for inputdata 
                                   (default /cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata)
     -debug [or -d]                Do not actually run -- just print out what 
                                   would happen if ran.
     -dynpft "filename"            Dynamic PFT/harvesting file to use if you have a manual list you want to use
                                   (rather than create it on the fly, must be consistent with first year)
                                   (Normally NOT used)
     -fast_maps                    Toggle fast mode which doesn't use the large mapping files
     -glc_nec "number"             Number of glacier elevation classes to use (by default 10)
                                   (CRITICAL OPTION)
     -merge_gis                    If you want to use the glacier dataset that merges in
                                   the Greenland Ice Sheet data that CISM uses (typically
                                   used only if consistency with CISM is important)
     -hirespft                     If you want to use the high-resolution pft dataset rather 
                                   than the default lower resolution dataset
                                   (low resolution is at half-degree, high resolution at 3minute)
                                   (hires only available for present-day [2000])
     -exedir "directory"           Directory where mksurfdata_map program is
                                   (by default assume it is in the current directory)
     -inlandwet                    If you want to allow inland wetlands
     -no-crop                      Create datasets without the extensive list of prognostic crop types
     -no_surfdata                  Do not output a surface dataset
                                   This is useful if you only want a landuse_timeseries file
     -years [or -y] "years"        Simulation year(s) to run over (by default 2005) 
                                   (can also be a simulation year range: i.e. 1850-2000 or 1850-2100 for ssp_rcp future scenarios)
                                   (CRITICAL OPTION)
     -help  [or -h]                Display this help.

     -rundir "directory"           Directory to run in
                                   (by default current directory /cluster/home/huit/ctsm/tools/mksurfdata_map)

     -ssp_rcp "scenario-name"      Shared Socioeconomic Pathway and Representative Concentration Pathway Scenario name(s).
                                   "hist" for historical, otherwise in form of SSPn-m.m where n is the SSP number
                                   and m.m is the radiative forcing in W/m^2 at the peak or 2100.
                                   (normally use thiw with -years 1850-2100)
                                   (CRITICAL OPTION)
     
     -usrname "clm_usrdat_name"    CLM user data name to find grid file with.

     -vic                          Add the fields required for the VIC model
     -glc                          Add the optional 3D glacier fields for verification of the glacier model

      NOTE: years, res, and ssp_rcp can be comma delimited lists.

OPTIONS
     NOTE: The three critical options are (-years, -glc_nec, and -ssp_rcp) they are marked as such.

     -allownofile                  Allow the script to run even if one of the input files
                                   does NOT exist.

SYNOPSIS 

     For supported resolutions:
     mksurfdata.pl -res <res>  [OPTIONS]
        -res [or -r] "resolution" is the supported resolution(s) to use for files (by default usrspec ).

      
     For unsupported, user-specified resolutions:	
     mksurfdata.pl -res usrspec -usr_gname <user_gname> -usr_gdate <user_gdate>  [OPTIONS]
        -usr_gname "user_gname"    User resolution name to find grid file with 
                                   (only used if -res is set to 'usrspec')
        -usr_gdate "user_gdate"    User map date to find mapping files with
                                   (only used if -res is set to 'usrspec')
                                   NOTE: all mapping files are assumed to be in mkmapdata
                                    - and the user needs to have invoked mkmapdata in 
                                      that directory first
        -usr_mapdir "mapdirectory" Directory where the user-supplied mapping files are
                                   Default: ../mkmapdata

OPTIONS
     NOTE: The three critical options are (-years, -glc_nec, and -ssp_rcp) they are marked as such.

     -allownofile                  Allow the script to run even if one of the input files
                                   does NOT exist.
     -dinlc [or -l]                Enter the directory location for inputdata 
                                   (default /cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata)
     -debug [or -d]                Do not actually run -- just print out what 
                                   would happen if ran.
     -dynpft "filename"            Dynamic PFT/harvesting file to use if you have a manual list you want to use
                                   (rather than create it on the fly, must be consistent with first year)
                                   (Normally NOT used)
     -fast_maps                    Toggle fast mode which doesn't use the large mapping files
     -glc_nec "number"             Number of glacier elevation classes to use (by default 10)
