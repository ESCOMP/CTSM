The purpose of this directory is for users of CTSM to contribute scripts for pre or post processing or
case management of CTSM that others might find useful.  The script should have some documentation made 
available before adding it. These scripts may not be as well tested or supported as other CTSM
tools. They are also ONLY assumed to work on the NCAR supercomputer. So paths will be hardwired to
assume NCAR directory structures.

The python scripts require the following settings before running on cheyenne:
(Currently that's the singlept and subset_surfdata scripts)

module load python/2.7.14
ncar_pylib

Brief description of scripts:

run_clm_historical
	does all the setup and submission required to do a 1850-2010 CLM 
	historical simulation in three separate submissions
        v1 - Andrew Slater+Dave Lawrence, 8/2015

subset_surfdata
	create regional domain, surface data, and rtm directional files by 
	extracting data from global datasets 
	v1 - Sean Swenson 8/2015

singlept
	create single point domain, surface data, and datm forcing files by 
        extracting data from global datasets
	v1 - Sean Swenson 8/2015

SpinupStability_SP_v9.ncl
        This script assesses the equilibrium state of a Satellite Phenology (SP) 
        spinup run, works on either monthly or annual mean history files - Keith
        Oleson 12/2021

SpinupStability_BGC_v10.ncl
        This script assesses the equilibrium state of a Biogeochemistry (BGC) 
        spinup run, works on either monthly or annual mean history files - Keith
        Oleson 12/2021

run_clmtowers
        This script will run any number of flux tower sites.
        It's based on having created surface datasets with PTCLM.
        v1 - Keith Oleson, 8/2015

ssp_anomaly_forcing_smooth
        This script creates anomaly forcing for CMIP6 SSP scenarios that 
        can be used to run CTSM in CESM with datm.
        v0 -- Sean Swenson
        v1 - Peter Lawrence 3/2020
