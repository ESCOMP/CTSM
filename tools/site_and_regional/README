The purpose of this directory is to contain all of the scripts that involve creating CTSM input data files
for single site as well as regional cases.

The python scripts require the following settings before running on cheyenne:

module load python
ncar_pylib

Brief description of scripts:

subset_data
    This script extracts domain files, surface dataset, and DATM files
    at either a single point or a region using the global dataset.
    For extracting domain files, surface dataset, and DATM files at a single point, use:
        ./subset_data point

    For extracting domain files, surface dataset, and DATM files at a region, use:
        ./subset_data region

modify_singlept_site_neon.py
    After running subset_data.py overwrite some fields with site-specific
    data for neon sites.

run_neon.py
    Wrapper script for running CTSM simulations for one or more
    neon sites for spin-up or transient run types.

neon_surf_wrapper.py
    Wrapper script that run subset_data to extract data for all neon points and then
    use modify_singlept_site_neon.py to update site-specific fields.
    This code uses neon_sites_dompft.csv to determine --dompft (dominant pft types) values.

neon_s3_upload
    Script to rename and upload NEON site finidat files to NEON s3 bucket
    for use in transient startup cases

DEPRECATED SCRIPTS:

Master perl scripts that call the other ncl scripts:

mknoocnmap.pl 
        Script to create unity mapping dataset for single-point
        or regional studies over land-only (no ocean).

NCL Scripts available:

mkunitymap.ncl
        NCL script to create a unity map -- ran by above script (mknoocnmap.pl)
