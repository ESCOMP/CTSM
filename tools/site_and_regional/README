The purpose of this directory is to contain all of the scripts that involve creating CTSM input data files
for single site as well as regional cases.

The python scripts require the following settings before running on cheyenne:

ncar_pylib

Brief description of scripts:

subset_data.py
	create regional domain, surface data, and rtm directional files by 
	extracting data from global datasets

        After running subset_data.py overwrite some fields with site-specific 
        data for neon sites
