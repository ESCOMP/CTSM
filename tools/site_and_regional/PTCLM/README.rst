PTCLM
=====

The PTCLM tool to set up PoinT CLM simulations,
is part of the Community Earth System Model.

See the CESM web site for documentation and information:

NOTE: PTCLM is being deprecated and replaced by a different process

A limitation of PTCLM was speed and computing requirements. By doing the 
same process as for global datasets mapping files for high resolution 
datasets needed to be created which even for a single point requires 
large computing platforms. The new process modifies existing global datasets
and as such can be done simply even on a laptop.
