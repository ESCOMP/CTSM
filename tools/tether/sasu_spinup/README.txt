steps:

1) ./create_config.sh
2) edit spinup.config a bit if you want,
   	- especially project, grid, and compset information
	- setup_config will apply nice defaults for any unset variables
3) ./setup_config.sh
4) examine the resulting config file
   	- it will be located in a separate directory
        - if you don't like the default names or directories, return to step 1
	- tinker and repeat as needed
