tools/README.filecopies			      May/26/2011

There are several files that are copies of the original files from
either CTSM src/utils or src/main, or share/src.
By having copies the tools can all be made stand-alone,
but any changes to the originals will have to be put into the tool
directories as well.

I. Files that are IDENTICAL:

   1. csm_share files copied that should be identical to share/src:

       shr_kind_mod.F90
       shr_const_mod.F90
       shr_string_mod.F90
       shr_file_mod.F90
       
II. Files with differences

   1. csm_share files copied with differences:

       shr_sys_mod.F90 - Remove mpi abort and reference to shr_mpi_mod.F90.

   2. CTSM src/utils files with differences:

       fileutils.F90 --- Remove use of masterproc and spmdMod and endrun in abortutils.

   3. Files in mksurfdata_esmf

       mkvarpar.F90
       nanMod.F90
