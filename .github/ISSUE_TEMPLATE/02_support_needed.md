### Important details of your setup / configuration so we can better assist you

**CTSM version you are using:** [output of `git describe`]

[If Yes: Please point us to your modifications. However: In general we can NOT support problems with modified code. Try to show the problem without modifications.]

**If you are having problems with a specific case: Is your case on a machine accessible to most CTSM developers (e.g., an NCAR machine)?** [Yes / No]

If Yes:

- Location of case directory: [Fill this in]

- Location of run directory: [Fill this in]

[If No: Please make sure you have included all important input and output needed to understand your issue, either by pasting it into the issue text, or by attaching relevant files. However: We are less likely to be able to reproduce your problem if the issue is NOT on an NCAR machine.]
