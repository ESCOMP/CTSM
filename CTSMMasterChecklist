Checklist of steps to do to make a CTSM Trunk Tag        Oct/1st/2018

CTSM Software Management team.

See the wiki page for this on:

https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/wiki/CTSM-development-workflow

(1) Update your branch to latest version of ESCOMP/ctsm master branch (git fetch followed
    by git merge)

(2) Make sure you have the latest version of code in your testing sandbox

   2a -- run 'git pull' to pull in the latest version from GitHub
   2b -- run 'git status' and/or 'git diff' to make sure you don't have any uncommitted
         local changes
   2c -- run './manage_externals/checkout_externals -S' to make sure all externals are
         updated and don't have any uncommitted changes. (If any are marked with 's' in
         the first column, run ./manage_externals/checkout_externals to update them.)

(3) Do all testing on your fork/feature-branch

   3a -- make sure any new failing tests are either fixed or approved as a new expected
         fail
   3b -- update the ExpectedFails list if expected fails changes in 1a
        $EDITOR cime_config/testdefs/ExpectedTestFails.xml
   3c -- make sure you understand any changes to the baselines -- to document in ChangeLog

(4) Use diff and status to make sure any new files are in the repo and only the correct
    changes are on the branch

   4a -- 'git status' to check that you've added any new files and haven't
         added any non source files that aren't needed in the repository
   4b -- 'git diff' to check that your changes are correct and you didn't accidentally
         add something unintentionally

(5) Update ChangeLog

   5a -- From the 'doc' directory, run './UpdateChangelog.pl TAGNAME "one-line summary"'.
         This will open an editor with the ChangeLog. You can edit it now (step 4b) or
         exit your editor and then reopen it manually.
   5b -- Fill in the ChangeLog entry
   5c -- Update date stamp on ChangeLog
        ./UpDateChangeLog.pl -update
   5d -- Commit new change files

(6) Submit a pull request (PR) for the changes
    Have someone review it if you are able. At minimum review it youself. The PR mechanism
    on git is an excellent way to code review code for both yourself and others. Also make
    sure all your changes are correct, changes that shouldn't have gone in don't, and all new
    files are added in.

---- THE FOLLOWING CAN ONLY BE DONE BY INTEGRATORS ----

(7) Merge the PR to master when review is approved

(8) Compare master to branch show that they are identical

git diff master remote/feature-branch

This should show no diffs

(9) Make an annotated tag on master

(10) Push master and tag to ESCOMP/ctsm

---- NOTES ----

(3) -- Always test on your fork with a feature-branch so that we can change tag order if needed. Put 
baselines in the next tag name, as we can easily change afterwards if needed.
