# build-namelist
#
# This script builds the namelists for CLM
#
# The simplest use of build-namelist is to execute it from the build directory where configure
# was run.  By default it will use the config_cache.xml file that was written by configure to
# determine the build time properties of the executable, and will write the files that contain
# the output namelists in that same directory.  But if multiple runs are to made using the
# same executable, successive invocations of build-namelist will overwrite previously generated
# namelist files.  So generally the best strategy is to invoke build-namelist from the run
# directory and use the -config option to provide the filepath of the config_cache.xml file.

                              "-sim_year list" to list valid simulation years
     -bgc_spinup "on|off"     CLM 4.5 Only. For CLM 4.0, spinup is controlled from configure.
                              Turn on given spinup mode for BGC setting of CN
                              on : Turn on Accelerated Decomposition (spinup_state = 1)
                              off : run in normal mode (spinup_state = 0)

                              Default is off.

                              Spinup is now a two step procedure. First, run the model
                              with spinup = "on". Then run the model for a while with
                              spinup = "off". The exit spinup step happens automatically
                              on the first timestep when using a restart file from spinup
                              mode.

                              The spinup state is saved to the restart file.
                              If the values match between the model and the restart
                              file it proceeds as directed.

                              If the restart file is in spinup mode and the model is in
                              normal mode, then it performs the exit spinup step
                              and proceeds in normal mode after that.

                              If the restart file has normal mode and the model is in
                              spinup, then it enters spinup. This is useful if you change
                              a parameter and want to rapidly re-equilibrate without doing
                              a cold start.

     -test                    Enable checking that input datasets exist on local filesystem.
     -verbose [or -v]         Turn on verbose echoing of informational messages.
     -use_case "case"         Specify a use case which will provide default values.
                              "-use_case list" to list valid use-cases.

     -bgc "value"           Build CLM with BGC package [ sp | cn | bgc ]
                              (default is sp).

                                     (or CLM45CN if phys=clm4_5, use_cn=true)
                              bgc = Carbon Nitrogen with methane, nitrification, vertical soilc,
                                    century decomposition
                                    (or CLM45BGC if phys=clm4_5, use_cn=true, vsoilc_centbgc='on',

Note: The precedence for setting the values of namelist variables is (highest to lowest):
      0. namelist values set by specific command-line options, like, -d, -sim_year
             (i.e.  CLM_BLDNML_OPTS env_run variable)
      1. values set on the command-line using the -namelist option,
             (i.e. CLM_NAMELIST_OPTS env_run variable)
      2. values read from the file(s) specified by -infile,
             (i.e.  user_nl_clm files)
      3. datasets from the -clm_usr_name option,
             (i.e.  CLM_USRDAT_NAME env_run variable)
      4. values set from a use-case scenario, e.g., -use_case
             (i.e.  CLM_NML_USE_CASE env_run variable)
      5. values from the namelist defaults file.
