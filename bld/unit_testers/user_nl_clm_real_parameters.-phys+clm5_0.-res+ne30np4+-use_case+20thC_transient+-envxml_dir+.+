! Only relevant if reset_snow_glc is .true.When resetting snow pack over glacier columns, one can choose to do this over all glaciercolumns, or only those below a certain elevation. A typical use case is to reset only those columns that have a seasonal snow pack in the real world, i.e. SMB less than 0, also known as the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). This parameter sets a single global ELA value. Bysetting this parameter to a large value (i.e. 10000 m), all glacier columns will be reset.WARNING: This variable is intended for short test runs, and generallyshould not be used for scientific production runs. By resetting snowbelow a given elevation, you risk forcing the system to evolvedifferently in areas below and above reset_snow_glc_ela.
