"""Utilities to facilitate logging

A guide to logging in ctsm python scripts:

- At the top of each module, you should have:
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

- Logging should be done via that logger, NOT via logging.[whatever]

- If you want to allow the user to control logging via command-line arguments, you should:

  (1) At the very start of a script / application, call setup_logging_pre_config(). (We
      need to initialize logging to avoid errors from logging calls made very early in the
      script.)

  (2) When setting up the argument parser, call add_logging_args(parser)

  (3) After parsing arguments, call process_logging_args(args)

- If you don't want to allow the user to control logging via command-line arguments, then
  simply:

  (1) At the very start of a script / application, call setup_logging() with the desired
      arguments

- In unit tests, to avoid messages about loggers not being set up, you should call
  setup_logging_for_tests (this is typically done via unit_testing.setup_for_tests)
