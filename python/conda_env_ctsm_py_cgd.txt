# NOTE: This version is just for cgd.ucar.edu systems, where conda limits python to version 3.7.0
#       See issue https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/1792
#
#       This should be coordinated with the main python environment file!
#
# To install this on cheyenne with conda loaded in modules
# use the top level bash script:
# ../py_env_create                                           # Do this each time you update your CTSM Version
# conda activate ctsm_pylib                                  # Do this anytime you want to run a CTSM python script
# Or the individual conda commands:
# conda create  -n ctsm_pylib                                # Do this one time for each machine
# conda install -n ctsm_pylib --file conda_env_ctsm_py.txt   # Do this each time you update your CTSM Version
# conda activate ctsm_pylib                                  # Do this anytime you want to run a CTSM python script
#
