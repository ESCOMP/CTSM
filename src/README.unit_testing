# To run all CTSM unit tests on caldera, run the following command:
#
# The creation of a temporary directory ensures that you are doing a completely
# clean build of the unit tests. (The use of the --clean flag to run_tests.py
# cleans most, but not all of the files created by the unit test build.) For
# rerunning the tests after an incremental change, you can instead use an
# existing build directory.

# From a standalone CTSM checkout:
../cime/scripts/fortran_unit_testing/run_tests.py --build-dir `mktemp -d --tmpdir=. unit_tests.XXXXXXXX`

# If you are within a full CESM checkout, you would instead do:
# ../../../cime/scripts/fortran_unit_testing/run_tests.py --build-dir `mktemp -d --tmpdir=. unit_tests.XXXXXXXX`
