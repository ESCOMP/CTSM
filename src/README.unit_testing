# To run all CTSM unit tests, run the following command:
#
# This reuses the existing 'unit_tests.temp' directory (if present) in
# order to do an incremental rebuild of the unit tests from the last
# time you ran them from this directory.

# From a standalone CTSM checkout:
../cime/scripts/fortran_unit_testing/run_tests.py --build-dir unit_tests.temp

# If you are within a full CESM checkout, you would instead do:
# ../../../cime/scripts/fortran_unit_testing/run_tests.py --build-dir unit_tests.temp
