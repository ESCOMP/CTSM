Code in this directory implements a set of general-purpose thread-safe timing
routines, callable from Fortran or C.  Only the Fortran interface will be
described here.  For backward compatibility with an older library, interface
names "t_xxx" are still supported, but hopefully the new names "gptlxxx" will
be migrated to soon.  The mapping of names is:

old              new
-------------    -------------- 
t_setoptionf  -> gptlsetoption
t_initializef -> gptlinitialize
t_startf      -> gptlstart
t_stopf       -> gptlstop
t_prf         -> gptlpr
t_stampf      -> gptlstamp

When the new (gptl) names were implemented, the ability to access low level
hardware counters (e.g. to count floating point ops, cache misses, etc.)
provided by the library PAPI (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/) was also defined.
If PAPI has been built, accessing its capabilities is provided through
gptlsetoption (or t_setoptionf).  Commented out code which does this is
included in cam.F90.  One of the calls for example is:

!   if (gptlsetoption (PAPI_FP_OPS, 1) < 0) call endrun ('CAM:gptlsetoption')

Access to the PAPI library is set up at CAM build time by changing the
Makefile in the following way:

o Add to USER_CPPDEFS: -DHAVE_PAPI (-WF,-DHAVE_PAPI for AIX)
o Add to USER_CFLAGS (if appropriate): -Ixxx argument to define where papi.h lives.
  NOTE: on bluesky there is an old papi.h in /usr/local/include that
  shouldn't be used.  So by hook or by crook make sure that the correct
  papi.h gets used.  I did this for example by adding $(HOME)/include where
  cpp_dirs is set, BEFORE $(INC_NETCDF) and $(INC_MPI), because netcdf and/or
  mpi may reside in /usr/local along with the old papi.h.
o Add to USER_FFLAGS (if appropriate): -Ixxx argument to define where f77papi.h
  lives.
o Add to USER_LDFLAGS: -L and -l arguments to tell the loader where to find
  the PAPI library.
o On AIX add also to USER_LDFLAGS: -lpmapi
o On AIX if running in threaded mode (which is likely): change
  THREADED_PTHREADS to THREADED_OMP.  
o On AIX if running in threaded mode: change cc to cc_r
o Add to USER_CFLAGS if running in threaded mode: the appropriate compiler
  argument to enable threading.  For AIX it is -qsmp=omp.  For IRIX64 it is
  -mp.  For ifort it is -openmp.  And so on.

My recommendation is not to mess with a PAPI release prior to 3.0.7.  There
were bugs prior to that which rendered results unreliable or useless,
particularly under AIX.  

If and when new PAPI options become available, the one file in this directory
that will require modification is gptl_papi.c.  This is where the list of
events countable by PAPI is mapped to a print string.  The definition of
"papitable" in that file will need to be changed accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normal usage of the timing library (whether PAPI is enabled or not), using
the old interface names, is as follows:

#include <gptl.inc>
...
t_setoptionf (timing_option, value)
...
t_initializef ()
...
t_startf ('arbitrary_timer_name')
...
t_stopf ('arbitrary_timer_name')
...
t_prf (mpi_task_id)

also

t_stampf (wall, usr, sys)

An arbitrary number of calls to t_setoptionf() preceeds a single call to
t_initializef(), and all should be within a non-threaded code region.
Default behavior with zero calls to t_setoptionf() is to output statistics
for user time, system time, and wallclock time.  The function's purpose is to
modify this default behavior.  For example, t_setoptionf (usrsys, 0) turns
off user and system timings.  t_setoptionf (wall, 1) turns on wallclock
timings.  Other options (e.g. pcl_l1dcache_miss) are not available in the
committed code.  Include file gpt.inc need only be included where
t_setoptionf() is called.

An arbitrary sequence of (potentially nested) paired calls to t_startf() and
t_stopf() with unique timer names of up to 15 characters each can then occur.
The call to t_prf() will produce a summary of all timer values.  The argument
to t_prf() is normally the MPI task id, but can be any integer.  The output
file with the timing information will be named timing.<num>.  If threading
was enabled and timing calls were made from within threaded regions of the
code, a per-thread summary will be included in this output file.

Stand-alone routine t_stampf(wall, usr, sys) can be called to return
values for use in the application code.  The wallclock user, and system
timestamps returned are real*8 numbers in units of seconds.

The underlying library routine used to gather user and system times is
times().  Unfortunately, the behavior of this routine is not consistent
across platforms.  On IBM and Compaq, it is cumulative across threads.  On
SGI and PC machines it is thread-specific.  This behavior will be reflected
in the printed timings.  For example, on a 4-PE dedicated node the user time
for a given routine called from within a threaded region may exceed the
wallclock number by as much as a factor of 4 on IBM and Compaq machines.
